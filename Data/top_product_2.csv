B006MONQMC,"Light and flavorful; helps me drink more water I need to drink more water during the day.  The Vitamin Squeeze gives regular water a nice light flavor of fruit punch, helping me accomplish the goal of being well hydrated.  The vitamins are a nice added benefit.  One small downside is that the Vitamin Squeeze does need to be refrigerated after opening.  Otherwise, it's a great product.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Wasn't bad I am a really big fan of these squeeze drinks for water and I have to say that this one isn't that bad at all. The taste is a very mild fruit punch unless you squeeze a lot into your glass, and overall the flavor really isn't that bad. Sweet, yet mellow but it definitely isn't your normal fruit punch flavor. For it does remind me of a more childlike or even a more watered down and less sugar added HiC pouches I use to drink in middle school. Yet for people you want something different then the normal water this adds something plus I do enjoy the fact that it does hold a little bit of a vitamin energy to help get you through the day. I was squeezing this into my water bottle and taking it on the go when I go out to work out and had found that it helps keep me hydrated and even a little energized.<br /><br />I have to recommend these type of drinks for people who are tired of just regular water, would like to get some extra vitamin's when a water adder but I do wish the taste could be more improved and that there are clear directions on exactly how much a squeeze is really needed. I usually do it to taste but this packaging does make it hard to understand.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Great vitamin/mineral additive I'm not a water drinker and have to force myself to drink it. I constantly look for ways to supplement plain water to make it more palatable so decided to try this product.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy additive, this does give you vitamins and minerals that water lacks. However, that said there are a lot of additives and as you can see by the ingredient listings 'water' is the first ingredient:<br /><br />Water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12<br /><br />The directions say to do a one squeeze into 8 ounces of water. I didn't really care for it in plain water. Seemed a bit metallic to me, not overwhelming, but nothing to make me want to gulp water all day! I drink a lot of tea, sparkling soda and Crystal Light type products so I ended up using it in pitchers of Crystal Light and sparkling water. It was very good used that way and of course you feel good thinking you are getting vitamins with your Aspartame based drinks. I tried the fruit punch supplement in raspberry tea, but lets just say--not so good.<br /><br />Finally, I can't say I noticed any extra energy descending upon me, but I like the fact that this provides some vitamin intake I might not otherwise get during my liquid imbibing.",1,-1
B006MONQMC,"How much is a ""squeeze""? This vitamin/caffeine additive to plain water is not overly delicious.  It has a rather strong cough syrup flavor, even at a ""small squeeze"" portion, and it is VERY RED.  There is not a single direction about how big a squeeze should be, though I suppose at 24 portions, one could divide and assume it is .5 oz.  I was hoping for a bit of a morning ""pick up,"" but the caffeine level is not enough for any sort of boost.  I'd rather take my vitamins as a pill and can't recommend this water-flavorer.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"So-so water additive I'm all for products that increase my water intake throughout the day.  While I enjoy plain water, an extra added flavor boost is welcome at times. I found Vitamin Squeeze to be just OK in my opinion.<br />Pros:  Easy to use and not very messy. Flip the cap, squeeze into water, shake and you're done.  It has a good quantity of vitamin C and B vitamins, which help boost my energy level, 40 mg of caffeine and some electrolyte replenishment with added potassium.  It's a good product for use after a workout.<br />Cons:  You should refrigerate it after opening according to the package.  That makes it hard to store in the car or gym bag.  I'm also not a fan of the sucralose, and wish they had just used a little natural sweetener.  The sucralose gives me a headache, and I could do without that in a product.  I'm also not always looking for caffeine after a workout, and wish they'd left this out as well.  With the B vitamins and electrolytes, I think it was unnecessary.  Flavor is fair.  You can increase or decrease the strength of the flavor with how much you put into your water.  One squeeze is just faintly sweet and fruity to me.  This brings up my other beef - I wish the directions and serving size were not 'one squeeze'.  If I'm feeling feisty, a squeeze can be two tablespoons.  You can also squeeze out half a teaspoon if you're gentle with it.  I wish this was more standardized, especially with 40 mg caffeine in a serving.  If you look at the fine print, a serving is 15 ml.  Not everyone is going to know this is three teaspoons.  They could have put three teaspoons right out there so it was clear.<br />Will I get this again after I run out?  Probably not.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Good flavor and Not too sweet I drink a lot of bottled water, all day, everyday and the fruit punch flavor was a pleasant change to my usual plain water.  I do like that it has added vitamins, but it still doesn't make this a healthier product.  I'd prefer the coloring be removed and no artificial sweeteners added, and instead use natural or no color with fruit juice &lt; would be a nice change >.<br />If you are just looking for an occasional flavor boost and don't mind the dye, you might enjoy this.  The bottle was easy to use, once I cut the inner seal off.  The boost of vitamins didn't have much impact for me, but the flavor is good.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Like a faster & easier Crystal Light, with caffeine & vitamins. These days, it seems like there's a caffeinated version of everything. Caffeine gum. Caffeine water. Caffeine workout pills and powders. Caffeine shots (5-hour energy). Super-caffeinated 'energy' soda. I guess it makes sense that now they're making a caffeinated version of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007AXVG8K"">Mio Energy Liquid Water Enhancer, 3 - Count</a>.<br /><br />As a 'water enhancer', this stuff is decent. It's not much different from the generic fruit flavor of other low/no-calorie 'water enhancers' like Crystal Light or Mio. It's got some good points, like 120% vitamin C and 40% of multiple B-vitamins, as well as some zinc and chromium. It's got a moderate caffeine zip (40mg per serving... one squeeze = one serving, two squeezes will nicely flavor a bottle of water), but it's not excessive as some energy sodas or workout powders can be.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that artificial sweeteners and caffeine are becoming WAY too common in American food/beverages (I normally try to avoid these kinds of things, but am reviewing this for the Vine program), there's only one downside to this product -- the container leaks slightly. I know it's not just my particular sample, because my coworker saw it and warned me before I'd even taken off the safety seal. I guess there's just something quirky about the design.<br /><br />All in all, this stuff tastes decent, packs a nice little B&C Vitamins punch and will give you a nice zip thanks to its caffeine content.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Good flavor, not sure about benefits The fruit punch flavor is very artificual, but I kinda liked it. It was sweet and fruity. It reminds me of Hawaiian Punch a lot. The flavor stayed with me for a long time and I didn't mind because it was good.<br /><br />I can't comment as to whether or not it gave me more energy. I didn't feel ""energized"" but at the same time, I was able to stay awake and alert after a bad night of storms and not sleeping.<br /><br />What I like about it isn't the energy aspect of it, but the vitamins. One serving (1/2oz) provides 120% vitamin c, 40% of b6, b5, b3, and b12, and all with no sugar or calories. Fir someone with a limited diet due to family allergies, this is really useful.<br /><br />I would like to see if there are other flavors that aren't so full of red food coloring.<br /><br />I drank some after running and found that my energy didn't drop off and I stayed feeling good so I think I'm sold in it!",1,0
B006MONQMC,"A tasty and convenient way to get a does of energy and vitamin C. I have tried other ""flavor enhancers"" for water and founded that they tasted so artificial that they took away from the flavor of regular water instead of adding to it.  This one tastes really good and provides the added benefit of some vitamins and energy in the form of caffeine.  I enjoy it and find it very convenient.  I think that you will like it too.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Taste is there but it stains, bad!!! During the day I wake up and drink cold coffee and sometimes use my Tassimo maker. The rest of the day I drink a lot of water. I usually drink bottled water and do not mind the `plain' taste.<br /><br />Sadly I can not read the ingredients on my bottle since it is covered with a sticker but the vitamin part seemed interesting. I have tried to add flavors to my water before but they have tasted artificial. I will say this does taste like fruit punch as it is listed. I was surprised at how flavorful it was and that it did not taste artificial like the other drinks I have tried. I found it rather refreshing and loved the flavor of it.<br /><br />The reason I would not buy it though is it is messy. I accidentally squeezed some out of the cup and it was so sticky. That was not the worse. I have cream colored counters and it leaked on them and it was less than 10 seconds of it sitting on the counter and figured a wet paper towel would wipe it up. Nope, it was already stained! I was shocked! I had to use one of those magic eraser pads to clean it off the counter. For how sticky and how easily it stains, it is not worth it to me.<br /><br />Taste wise it is there. However, if it stained that quickly, I wonder what it does to your body. I don't think I will be finishing it.<br /><br />Added after writing review: If I could give this a zero I would! I had the bottle near the computer to write the review. It has to be in the fridge after you open it. It was in the fridge with the cap down. I flipped it where the cap was on top thinking it would not leak this way taking it back to the fridge. Nope, the cap held the previous leftover squeeze and it leaked ALL over my cream rug and also my computer stand which is padded. I got rid of it. It is too messy and stains!",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"Tastes like weak Hawaiian Punch with ingredients I don't want I try to consume natural products as much as is conveniently possible. I also try to avoid food products with added chemicals as much as is conveniently possible. I exercise a lot and need to stay hydrated and be sure I get necessary electrolytes. I thought I'd try this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink.<br /><br />You dispense this by a ""squeeze."" How much is a squeeze? Good question. The label says a serving size is 1/2 fl oz. I have no idea how much that is when delivered as a squeeze but I guess I can get a shot glass and figure it out. A bottle of this has 24 servings and apparently it is up to you to decide how much water you need for a serving. My experience with it is that 16 ounces of water is way too much for one squeeze of this stuff... it results in a very weak tasting drink. So you can then squeeze more but then you'd be getting more of the vitamins and other stuff...<br /><br />I take a daily multi-vitamin, Vitamin D and B-complex vitamin. I don't really need vitamins in my water and I sure don't need sucralose and this has both. So for those reasons I would not purchase this product in the future.<br /><br />As for the taste, it reminded me of a weak Hawaiian Punch. It wasn't what I would characterize as a natural tasting fruit flavor even though the label mentions ""natural flavor"" but it doesn't exactly specify what that is. This also has 40mg of caffeine.<br /><br />To me, this is just a weird product. Just because you can add vitamins, caffeine and some assorted ""electrolytes"" doesn't mean you need to. I get energy drinks, I just don't get this one.",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"Like the pick-me-up Gotta say, having an instant energy boost I can just squeeze into a glass of water or my water bottle for a day at the office is really quite handy.  I feel about as energized as a glass of juice or a milder energy drink would leave me--so don't really expect this to fulfill high energy expectations.  This fills the niche of a nice, nutritious water enhancer with a bit of a pick-me-up.  No jitters here.  I like the flavor, though the recommended squeeze-to-water ratio leaves the taste a bit on the light side.  Which also begs the questions, just how much is a squeeze?  In many ways this is rather gimmicky, but if it's your thing, it certainly does all that it announces.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Just OK I really do not want to review this because I sort of like the taste, at least at first, then there is the after taste.  I do not like to have an aftertaste when I eat or drink anything.<br />The flavor, at first, was very refreshing as long and you keep drinking it.<br />If you are one that is used to diet flavors then you will probably love this. It is a typical diet water, but they say it is natural.  I am not sure but is caffeine natural and sucralose?<br />I would rather just have plain old white sugar at least I know what to expect and it tastes a lot better than this.<br /><br />With all that said the packaging is fine, I like the squirting cap it is like the new ketchup bottles that stand upside down.  So if they could just take away the after taste on this flavored water I would give it a 4 star but for now it only deserves 3.  I am being generous.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Really Enjoy This Water Enhancer I've tried the Mio and now the Vitamin Squeeze water enhancers.  I didn't like the taste of the Mio, but love the taste of this one, which is Fruit Punch (a flavor I normally avoid because it is so sweet).  I didn't really feel an energy rush with this drink, but I did feel pretty good, which I would assume would be the vitamins!<br /><br />One great thing about this water enhancer: no aspertame!  I'm actually allergic to aspertame, and have a really hard time finding water flavorings that don't contain it.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients:  Water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12<br /><br />One bottle is supposed to flavor about 24 8oz glasses of water.  I actually like mine a bit lighter on the Fruit Punch flavor, so I think it is going to last longer.<br /><br />The only down-side to this water enhancer is that the bottle is pretty big, so there really is no sneaking this one into my purse to flavor water on-the-go.<br /><br />In all, this one is a keeper and I WILL be getting more!  I can't wait to try the Acai, Grape Pomegranate!",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamin squeeze... Gives you zero calories and some vitamins and minerals, I can live with it as a vitamin and mineral drink.<br /><br />Why does the drink have to be sweetened with artificial sweetener? I can live with a drink that has a small amount of natural sugar, that's what I usually do if I want to cut down on sugar, just use less instead of using the far worse artificial sweetener.<br /><br />But what this drink fails most from is the flavor. It reminds me and my kids of cherry flavored cough syrup, not a flavor that people want to be reminded of. The other flavors might be ok, if I want multivitamins, I'd probably take a multivitamin pill and just drink water.",0,-1
B006MONQMC,"Caffeine and Vitamin C Served Up In A Drink Reminiscent Of Watered Down Sugar Free Kool-Aid I picked up the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink to take to work and give a boost to my water consumption. Who couldn't use a bit more vitamin C or energy? While there is some nutritional value in the vitamin content, the drink is also loaded with artificial ingredients. The caffeine content, alone, seems counterintuitive to something that wants to market itself as healthful. So, I'm not sure that Vitamin Squeeze has exactly figured out which niche in the marketplace it wants to fulfill. Health or energy? By making claims to both, it also falls short of either.<br /><br />The one thing I did like is that the bottle is much bigger than other water additives (heck, the waste of plastic and processing on those tiny bottles drives me insane). The instructions say that you add a squeeze to 8 ounces of water. That would make 24 servings in the bottle supposedly. One problem, a squeeze isn't a real unit of measurement. With too little, there is no taste at all and if you use enough to notice--you'll probably only end up with 8-10 servings. The taste, even with extra squeezing, is like diluted sugar free kool-aid. It's not awful, but it has a pronounced aftertaste. If you're looking for a caffeine supplement, you might find this appealing enough. But it's not something that I would revisit for either the vitamins or the caffeine. KGHarris, 6/12.",0,-1
B006MONQMC,"Good idea, but not quite there yet Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch. Sounds like a good idea, to add more vitamins to your daily water intake, right?<br />As far as vitamins, what you are getting is a good dose of B vitamins, which is nice. My main issue is that, along, with the vitamins, you get caffeine, sucralose (artificial sweetener), sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (preservatives) and Red #40, which oddly isn't listed on the Amazon description.<br />And, what the heck is ""natural flavor"" when no juice is listed? That is kinda scary!<br /><br />The design of the bottle is nice. I like the shape which encourages a firm grip. ! It certainly is sealed well, with both an outer ring of packaging and an under cap seal.<br /><br />The taste of this particular flavor, Fruit Punch, is exactly what I would expect from Kool Aid of the same flavor. That nasty ""red"" aftertaste, thanks to the #40 food coloring. I would be careful using this product because I am pretty sure that it is going to stain just as bad as other red colored drinks.<br /><br />Do the benefits of vitamins offset the negative effects of the additives? Personally, I don't think so. I will not be buying this product.",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"If you need to add flavor So I want to start out by saying the hinge for the lid broke right when I opened it up, I also think it taste a lot like kool aid. I have had different kinds of water enhancers like mio and amino energy before and both of those tasted better then this. Since the expiration date is 8/2013 I do plan to buy more to have for water flavor like if you have to treat your drinking water. Over all its ok and it doesn't have carbs calories or sugar so that a plus. Recommend for when you get tired of drinking water!",0,0
B006MONQMC,"An ""ok"" energy drink This product, the ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch"", offers a calorie free way to turn your water into a fruit-punch tasting energy drink.  One squeeze of the bottle will flavor 8 ounces of water.  Below are my impressions of this product:<br /><br />- It's hard to tell how much ""one squeeze"" is.  For my first glass, I gave the bottle a large squeeze, and discovered that I had put way too much flavoring in.  There are markings on the side of the bottle that show how much liquid would equate to one squeeze, but it's not transparent and you can't see the fluid level inside the bottle.  Through trial and error, I managed to work out how much of a squeeze flavored my water to the level I wanted it, though.<br />- It indeed tastes like fruit punch, but there is an aftertaste.  Given that it's artificially sweetened and fortified with vitamins, I expected that there would be.  It's about the same level of aftertaste as you might get from a glass of artificially sweetened kool-aid.  Not overpowering, but noticeable.<br />- I like that it's fortified with vitamins; while this might not be the best way to get them (eating nutritious foods is), every little bit helps!<br />- If you like energy drinks, this is an efficient way to store them.  One 12 ounce bottle effectively replaces 24 8 ounce cans.  All you need to do is add a ""squeeze"" to a glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />Overall, ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink"" gives you a shot of caffeine and some important vitamins per serving and is concentrated so that it won't take up a lot of room in your fridge.  But the taste to me is just ok.  And that's how I rate this drink: ""ok"", which in my scoring system is three stars.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Quick boost with added benefit I carry a 40 ounce <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019N2DO8"">Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Water Bottle</a> or a 1.5 liter Sigg Water Bottle just about everywhere I go.  In the afternoons, when my brain stops functioning and I get groggy, I tend to have a caffeine boost of some kind, which has meant making tea or coffee.  When it gets hot, those just don't work for me, and I don't like iced tea. I don't want to spend more money on single serving sized energy boosts.<br /><br />So, I've been interested in trying some of the new (to me at least) squirt options to add to my water bottle.<br /><br />I'm quite pleased.  The taste is good and there certainly is an energy boost.  The added vitamins also help me be at my optimum performance in the afternoons.<br /><br />A couple of minor quibbles which keep this from being ideal. It does need to be refrigerated after opening it the first time, which keeps it from traveling with me.  Also, and this is going to sound a bit silly, I'm not sure how much squeeze a ""squeeze"" takes. I give a couple of squeezes in my water bottles, which seems to work fine, but I'm just not sure what is too much or what is too little. I guess it's a matter of taste--which makes sense.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Just a squirt adds lots of great flavor! We have tried several other flavors, and brands of water flavoring that you just squirt in the bottle or glass.<br />This is the first time we have tried the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink.<br />I have to say the flavor is very refreshing and tastes very good.<br />Although, I did not notice much extra ""energy"".<br />At the same time it did not leave me feeling gittery or anxious.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Not usually fond of this type of product So I've tried this type of product before - I believe it was put out by Kraft (mio liquid) - but it ended up making my otherwise fresh, delicious, and pure water taste like a semi-polluted river from an industrial accident.  With less than high hopes for this Vitamin Squeeze, I poured myself some water, dumped some of this stuff in, drank it...and DIDN'T feel the need to spew it back out!<br /><br />In fact, it tasted quite a bit like Gatorade or Vitamin Water.  Somewhat pleasant, but not all the way...In fact, I'll probably use the rest of the bottle before making my final decision to keep buying/using it or not.  (Unlike the Kraft stuff that went straight to the trash.)<br /><br />The two main factors I don't like this are:<br />1.  Red #40.  Why can't a company spend a few extra cents and use something natural.  I don't want my kids drinking this (though I'm a little more lenient for myself.)  Swap that artificial flavors with Beet Juice...get the same redness without the additives.<br /><br />2.  The sweetener.  It's the sucralose or whatever stuff that leaves the weird aftertaste.  While certainly better than High Fructose Corn Syrup as far as what I want in my body, it's the aftertaste that is the biggest disappointment of the flavor of this stuff.  What's wrong with going ""old fashioned"" and using ""sugar?""  Surely, somebody still grows sugar somewhere in the world...<br /><br />If you're in the market for something like this, I'd recommend trying a single bottle before investing in a 4-pack case.  It's better than the competition, for sure...but might not be quite what you're hoping for.",1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes good, not great It is what it is: liquid drink concentrate in a handy squeeze bottle, which turns plain water into sort of a diet Kool-Aid (or Hi-C) with a bit of a caffeine jolt. One difference I saw between this and Mio drink concentrate (which I also tested through Vine) is that the Vitamin Squeeze label says to refrigerate after opening, while the Mio label says it doesn't require refrigeration. So I dunno what will happen to Vitamin Squeeze if, say, it's left in your gym bag in a hot car all day.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze is sweetened with sucralose aka Splenda, which doesn't give me and my family violent stomach cramps like sorbitol, so that's a plus.  The taste is like diet fruit punch, not as good as Crystal Light, but acceptable. My older daughter likes the taste also; younger one didn't.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Sweet Pro:<br />-----<br />Easy, and quickly (surprisingly!) dissolves in water without effort, and has that familiar sweet fruit punch flavor you know and love.<br /><br />Con<br />-----<br />If you're not looking for a sugary (or fake sugary) fruit punch mix, this isn't for you.<br /><br />I am fully of the opinion that this is just another no-sugar sugar drink parading as a health product.<br /><br />What you get is a red syrup that easily dissolves in water and tastes like that generic Hi-C/Kool-Aid/Hawaiian Punch Fruit punch. You know, the red sweet stuff.<br /><br />But I like it. I don't use very much because I like the less sweet version of that same artificial fruit punch flavor (I actually do like it. If you don't, steer clear). It's definitely not ""too sweet"" if you realize what you're in for. It is definitely NOT flavored water. It is fruit punch mix. But it's much, much easier than powder, and if you keep it on the shelf in your fridge, it will take up a lot less room than the equivalent bottles. You could easily use this in cocktails too.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Okay, but... This stuff tastes okay to me, but with a hint of aftertaste.  However, I obtained it for my daughter who needs some vitamin help right now due to a medical thing.

But other than that, I don't see a problem.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"OK Sugar Free Drink I am not a big fan of artificially flavored drinks, and this vitamin squeeze energy drink is no exception. I really don't like the aftertaste of such drinks. However, putting that aside, this is a fairly refreshing and nice-tasting drink as far as it goes. The flavor is a bit reminiscent of a cough syrup. The packaging and mixing are very convenient - I was surprised that you really didn't need any stirring or shaking for this solution to completely dissolve in water. This drink is a convenient option if you spend a lot of time in a place that has plenty of water fountains or water coolers, and very limited refrigerator space. Aside from the interesting packaging and the delivery method there is nothing all that special about this drink that would distinguish it form others in the same category.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"a big bottle to jazz up your water.... I use the mio beverage enhancers pretty regularly and was interested in trying the vitamin squeeze to see how it would compare.  Here are my pros/cons:<br /><br />Pros-not overly sweet, a nice big bottle (12 oz, next to under 2 oz. for the Mio), lots of vitamins and zero calories.  Makes getting in your water much easier.<br /><br />Cons-bottle needs to be refrigerated after opening (unlike the Mio).  This makes it not as portable for me.  No leaving it in a backpack or a desk drawer, that is the major drawback for me.  Though I liked this flavor, it tasted more citrusy than it tasted like fruit punch-not a big deal, but if you are expecting fruit punch flavor you won't get it here.<br /><br />Overall, I would consider purchasing for home use, but not portable enough due to needing refrigeration for it to be my ""go to"" brand for when I am away from home.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Better than many water flavorings with benefits First of all, I prefer plain water, but when I need a refreshing drink, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQMC"">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> fits the bill.  Better than MIO, in my opinion, I find that this gives me a very little boost when added to my water bottle for consumption while I work in my garden.  When I first tasted the drink prior to adding it to water, it reminded me of the liquid vitamins I gave to my daughter many years ago and I expected to not like it at all.  In the diluted state, it is rather refreshing and I expect to be able to consume a bottle within the thirty days it apparently will last after opening.  The bottle needs to be refrigerated after opening and I'd recommend not storing them in a heated environment.  Although caffeine is listed near the top of ingredients, I did not feel the effects when mixed as directed.  I imagine that for those who are drinking this for the jolt, you'd find it necessary to make a more concentrated solution and then you'd have the vitamins in excess.  Although I give this product 4 stars because it's better than average in taste compared to similar prouducts, I probably will not purchase it in the future because I prefer to have my vitamins separate from my caffeine.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Water Booster with Artificial Sweetener Vitamin Squeeze is a fun way to add flavor and vitamins to water.  For the price, it goes a pretty long way, and flavor can be adjusted to taste.  It is great that there is nutritional value rather than just coloring and flavor like some competitors.  The flavor is good, but not amazing.  My main warning is that although it says ""all natural,"" it does contain sucralose (Splenda) sweetener.  I don't mind a little here and there, but I have found that it interferes with my diet if I overdo it.  So, I would not use this in all of my water, but would use it for a treat here and there.  If you would like something natural to flavor water, SweetLeaf makes flavored liquid stevia.<br /><br />Overall, a decent way to get some vitamins if you do not mind artificial sweetener.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"I'm underwhelmed I'm not so sure about Vitamin Squeeze. It works a lot like Mio, just squeeze a bit into a glass or bottle of water and drink. We do need to refrigerate it after opening, which makes it less portable, and the bottle is pretty big. Mio is at least small and can be carried in a purse.<br /><br />The ""energy"" comes from a variety of vitamins and minerals and caffeine. The labeling says it's not for children, but I let my children try it. Let's just say they didn't care for it. Personally, I like the taste of Mio better. Vitamin Squeeze is a little too sweet without much flavor. I was underwhelmed.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Good Tasting, Good Energy - Recommended This Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is good tasting and definitely provides an energy kick. I like this type of additive and regularly use Mio, so expected to like the flavor and was also prepared the slight aftertaste from the artificial sweetener.<br /><br />The recommended serving size is ""one squirt"" per 8oz of water and I find that does make it sweet enough. The flavor is sort of generically ""fruity"" and is nicely refreshing. It is important to shake the container well before dispensing to ensure everything is well mixed.<br /><br />This does have a good energy lift from caffeine and Vitamin B, and also has significant Vitamin C content (120% per serving). Since this is a good sized bottle at 12oz (24 servings), it is more convenient to keep on hand in the kitchen than the smaller Mio bottles (which are nice to carry on trips).<br /><br />A good choice for home use, mostly due to the large size.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Not My Main Squeeze This water enhancer promises to infuse your water with a good tasting vitamin energy supplement.  I liked the design of the bottle.  Shake well and one squeeze will be enough for 8 ounces of water.  Fat free, carb free and calorie free, it certainly is a dieter's dream.  The fruit punch flavor was okay, a little bit fake, like maraschino cherry juice.  Not unpleasant but Hawaiian Punch has nothing to worry about.  The chemical aftertaste was not pleasant. I noticed no improvement in my energy level, but again, I am a fairly heavy coffee drinker so perhaps I've become caffeine resistant. This product must be refrigerated after opening and used within thirty days.<br /><br />I would use this only as a back up to MIO.  I found the MIO flavors more appealing and it doesn't have to be refrigerated.  The MIO container is more portable.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Convenient - Good Idea - Adequate Quality/Taste We were pretty excited to try this out especially for use with workouts etc..water doesn't always cut it and Gatorade etc gets a bit costly plus all the sugar and salt really adds up over time.<br /><br />First, the squeeze idea is great! No mess, no fuss, super simple to use. Vast improvement over powdered drinks (including gatorade)with the added benefit of being able to adjust for personal preference.<br /><br />I found a quick squeeze more than ample; my other half liked a bit more flavor. We both liked the ability to squeeze and go. So far so good. Will give the convenience a big PLUS!<br /><br />The so-so part is the flavor...I'm just not wild about the fruit punch flavor but would probably be willing to give other flavors a try and see if they are more to my liking. It's not bad per se, it's just not that good. At first I thought it was just me but spouse felt the same way. Will consider this more or less neutral since it's not great but certainly not bad either.<br /><br />Now for the thing that I don't really like...the vitamins. Yes, there is a nice range of vitamins and at first glance, that sounds fine BUT, the quality of the included vitamins is questionable. For example, for B12, cyanocobalmin is used rather than the more expensive (and bioavailable) methylcobalmin. To be perfectly fair, the vast majority of people probably won't/don't care and the idea of taking in some vitamins at all is an improvement. However, those that are health conscious and/or only use bioavailable forms of vitamins will be disappointed. I try not to take inferior vitamin types so that they don't block absorption of better/more available forms.<br /><br />All in all, a vast improvement over cola's. Very convenient. Not bad tasting but not great and selection of vitamins could be better.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Okay But Not as Good as Mio I've used different Mio flavors in the past to flavor water. After using this product I find I prefer them to this projduct.<br /><br />For one thing, the bottle is difficult to open. I finally had to get a knife to cut open the seal. Of course, the drink sprayed all over the place.<br /><br />It states that you need one squeeze for 8 ounces of water. The instructions for 'one squeeze' aren't very scientific, and it's a matter of trial and error to get the water flavored to your taste. The first time I tried it there was not enough flavor, so I had to squeeze it twice. It'd be nice if tiny drops came out instead of a stream.<br /><br />I'm usually a big fan of fruit punch flavors, but this one was kind of odd. Not terrible but not as flavorful as the Mio flavors I've tried in the past.<br /><br />The one advantage this product has over Mio is that it includes vitamins, though I doubt there's enough to make a real difference.<br /><br />All in all, this product is just okay.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Splenda sweet. It says ""all natural"", but the sweetener is artificial splenda (don't mind though).<br /><br />Fruit punch is not my fav taste but it's actually not bad. I used 2 squeezes for 24 oz bottle and got just a little taste to have a break from water. It was already sweet to me.<br /><br />I wish they would provide info about caffeine, how much in 1 tablespoon or anything so I would know how much I drink (being pregnant). But I can only assume is not much, especially in 2 squeezes..<br /><br />Overall nothing I got crazy about. Good idea but maybe I'd like different taste better.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Pretty good if you like the flavor. Vitamin Squeeze was very easy to use.  It gives you Vitamin C with no calories.  The mixture uses sucralose as the sweetener.  As with most artificial sweeteners, it may or may not trigger your bitter taste buds.  For me, it was also hard to get the right amount of sweetness:  It was either too light or too sweet.  If you can get the flavor right, then this is the energy drink for you.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"The easy way to take your vitamins What a fantastic idea.

I'd prefer it if it didn't come with a dose of caffeine (fine in the morning, not so great later in the day when it might keep me from sleeping well), but to others, that might be a plus.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Convenient and economical While a little sweet for my tastes (another flavor would probably have worked better for me), the squeeze-bottle convenience of this energy-drink product makes it easy to get as little or as much flavor in your water as you want, and there is far more product here than in some other squeeze-flavor additives. I don't know how much more energetic it made me, or how many vitamins I was actually ingesting, but it was good enough for what it is. I would buy it again.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Squeeze Me With zero calories, zero sugar and zero carbs, this is a great drink if you are trying to watch your waist line. This squeeze flavoring is much minder than some of the other similar style drink options on the market. When using the recommended amount, you will get something more akin to fruit punch flavored water vs. actual fruit punch. I don't think this is a bad thing, as our taste buds are conditioned for overly sweet drinks.<br /><br />The one thing I would warn against is that one of the main ingredients in this drink is sucralose (Splenda). So, if you are against the myriad of artificial sweeteners on the market today, this drink is definitely not for you.",1,0

B006MONQMC,"A Good Value for a Water Additive Compared to its competitors like Mio, I think Vitamin Squeeze is a good value, given the size and the decent nutritional value.

B006MONQMC,"another gimmick The best I can say about this product is that the color is lovely in the glass and on my skin and clothes where it stained me the first time I squeezed a bit too hard and it splattered me. The vividness of the color and the fact that it causes neon stains made me wonder if I should be ingesting it. But I did.<br /><br />The flavor is sickly sweet and very ""chemical"". Much like Hawaiian Punch, and about as healthy feeling. I could not find a concentration at which it tasted good without tasting like sucrose-sweetened Kool-Aid. If you like chemical-tasting diet Kool-Aid type drinks, you might enjoy this very much. I don't, so I didn't.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Better value and tastes better than Mio in my opinion, fruit punch flavor is pretty good I haven't tried a lot of water additives but I have tried several different flavors of Mio and didn't care much for the taste. Mio is also very costly for the size of the bottle which is less than 2 oz. and has no real nutritional value. I have only tried the Fruit Punch flavor but it's pretty good. I am not jumping with joy over the taste but it's my favorite so far out of what I have tried. It taste reminds me of Tahitian Treat soda but with much less sweetener. I like that it comes in a large 12 oz. bottle because value is very important to me and the price fairly reasonable to me. It also has added Vitamin C, B6, B5, B12, B3, Zinc, Chromium and Magnesium. It also has an unknown amount of caffeine but it only seems to have a small dose per serving because it's hardly noticeable. Overall I like this product look forward to trying other flavors.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"After taste galore I like Vitamin Water.  I was excited to see this.<br />I realize that taste is a very subjective thing.  I can't say that I liked it.  The plastic taste was pretty strong and the after taste did not go away.<br />I am not a big fan of Crystal Lite.  Mostly because it has an after taste that I do not like.  This was similar to that only a little stronger, and the taste stayed longer.<br /><br />If you can find a sample, I would suggest trying that first before buying a large bottle.  If you like it, it gets added to water to dilute it.  If you don't like it, you're not out too much money.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"I can drink it Definitely fruit punch, reminiscent of Hawaiian Punch (a flavor I remember from my childhood). This drink additive sports a full days RDA of vitamin C and nearly half of the RDA of four B vitamins, no sugar and an unknown quantity of caffeine per tablespoon serving size.<br /><br />I am a big advocate of B vitamins for stress relief, but cannot say that I have ever felt an energy boost from taking B-complex, and see the same lack of effect from this additive. I drink it daily on my way to the gym and, honestly, haven't seen much effect from this product other than the flavoring in my water. Maybe, those that do not regularly take a B-complex or drink the 2-3 cups of coffee that I do will feel more of a boost. The lack of B9 (folate) seems like an oversight being such an obvious benefit to women of child-bearing age.<br /><br />Overall, I can drink it but don't see myself going out of my way to buy more.

B006MONQMC,You control the potency and taste I like the do it yourself squeeze concept for a few reasons. First you control how much you want to put in.

And if you figure out how many drinks you can make with this bottle it's very cost-effective.,1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Surprisingly Wonderful Drink Additive...as Long as You Like Sucralose My expectations for this product were pretty low. To my surprise, I very much enjoyed Vitamin Squeeze. It provides a nice energy kick and some vitamins to your water. I liked the flavor just fine, but if you're sensitive to artificial sweeteners then it might now be for you. I like that I control the strength of the flavor, caffeine, taurine, etc. Depending on how I'm feeling, I can use a bit or a lot. As with all energy drinks, you need to careful with how much you consume; if you have too much then you'll have a big crash a few hours later.<br /><br />Bottom line: as long as you're not sensitive to sucralose then I recommend giving this drink additive a shot for a boost of energy and some vitamins.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Love the large sized bottle While I like the MIO additives, I am always hesitant about putting too much because of the small bottle it comes in. No hesitation here, with the larger bottle, I can get the flavor just as I want it without feeling I used too much. As to the flavor, it is a nice Fruit Punch, (still would prefer Grape or Lemonade). Zero Carbs, Calories & Sugar but with all the Vitamin C & B you need after a workout.<br /><br />If you prefer your water with some flavor, Vitamin Squeeze is your best bargain buy.",1,1

This product had a very nice Fruit Punch flavor, but an after taste that kicks in shortly after finishing the beverage (20 oz bottle in less than a couple of minutes).  I only took off one star for this, as I can not rate the product on the health benefits from only using one bottle of it.  Also, like I said above, this is the first product of its kind that I have tried and I do not have anything similar to compare it to (ie: Mio).  Would I buy it?  No.  Would I drink/use it again?

Squeezing the stuff into a bottle was iffy since the serving was 1 squeeze, but I must have had a pretty good grip because the stuff kept coming out until about 1/5 of the bottle was gone. Even with that amount of product, the taste was meh. It had a fairly weak flavor and of course there was the usual aftertaste you get with most artificial sweeteners.

B006MONQMC,"Kind of like a bigger Mio, with more drinks per bottle This product is quite like the Mio water enhancer (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4ADKU"">MIO Fruit Punch, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>), but with extra vitamins.  It tasted quite like liquid Jell-o to me.  Having tasted Mio before I do like this over a certain Mio flavor, but not than all flavors.  It is a decent sized bottle and overall tastes while only needing an average amount for the water: enhancer ratio.<br /><br />I buy a lot of these types of drinks, including the Propel packets, the Crystal Lights, the Mios, and the Lipton powders.  This larger size is more economical than the others, but the one minus is that you wouldn't want to carry this in a bag, while you can easily slip in a Propel or Lipton single-serve packet.  Therefore, for me, this is a complement to the other drink mixes I buy, not a full replacement.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to Mio users because it has a lot more per bottle and does taste better if you raise the ratio, plus you get the extra vitamins, but keep in mind that this wouldn't be something you'd slip into a sportsbag (or for my wife, a purse).",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer Fruit Punch is a refreshing start to my day! Tired of drinking the same bland, clear bottle of water every day at work or school?<br /><br />Looking for a source of Vitamin C and natural Caffeine with no calories or bitter coffee taste?<br /><br />If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer is a product you should try out soon.  Over the past few weeks, I have managed to empty an entire bottle of this product and wanted to share my experiences in this review.<br /><br />First, using Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer Fruit Punch flavor is very easy.  Just remove the top plastic, protective wrapping, unscrew the cap and take off the foil based seal.  Replace the cap and squirt 1/2 ounce into your cup of water.  The Water Enhancer seems to quickly dissolve in water and gives it a deep pink color.<br /><br />The Taste Of Enhanced Fruit Punch Water<br />Enhancing the flavor of pure water, is a simple thing to do.  Yet, Vitality Avitae Caffeinated Water has proven to me that you can mess it up real bad.  They made the mistake of adding no flavoring to mask the chemical taste of caffeine.<br /><br />With this product, we are told it has a fruit punch flavor and I heartily agree.  The fruit punch flavor hits your tongue and stays there.  In my opinion, it is mildly sweet but not overpowering in anyway.  You can increase the strength of the flavor by adding more Vitamin Squeeze but it can get to be rather strong.  Of course, you will also use up your little squeeze bottle faster as well.  Try not to apply this product in a cup with ice cubes because they will tend to keep it from dissolving into the rest of your water.<br /><br />Keep An Eye On The Serving Size!<br />My preferred water cup is a Tervis 24 ounce Big T Clear Tumbler with a McNeese State University logo inside.  The recommended serving size for Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch is half an ounce per 8 ounces of water.<br /><br />Maximize The Life Of Your Water Enhancer By Refrigerating It!<br />The energy and vitamin ingredients in this flavorful product should be preserved to maintain their peak effectiveness.<br /><br />In conclusion, after using Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch Flavor for four days, my energy levels have increased and my stamina has improved as well.  Could it be a side effect of drinking less sugar and more pure healthy water?  You be the judge!",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Love it but the price is holding me back from ordering more... I am in love with Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink!

No weird or funky aftertaste or anything!<br /><br />However at about 25¢+ per squeeze, I find it a bit too rich for my taste. Some Kool-Aid and zero calorie sweetener can make a similar tasting drink for MUCH less (and without the taurine and caffeine).<br /><br />If it was just a little bit cheaper, I'd be buying a truck load for the summer... but for now I'll just be sticking with plain ol' water.",1,1

I mixed it with fresh squeezed lemon juice to make a fruity lemonade, REALLY good and very refreshing and an extra vitamin C boost.  I added it to diet cola and it tasted kind of like a cherry coke.

It does contain caffeine which has it's plus and cons.<br /><br />What I really like about this is that it does not leave a residue on water bottles or glasses like Crystal Light or other similar products.  The down side is that this product recommends refrigerating after opening.  - While understandable this is a major drawback in that I cannot just store it on my desk at work (where I typically use this type of product).  I also like that I can adjust the intensity of flavor readily which is messier to do with the little individual powder packets.  - I was skeptical about the fruit punch flavor but it is not all that different than other fruit flavored individual packets.,1,1

Add in the extra cost (which I think is high vs. competitive products) and the fact that this product needs to be refrigerated after opening (and has a recommended 30 day life) and I just don't see why I'd buy this product in the future.

Mine wasn't open, apparently (yes - I unscrewed the cap and took off the protective cover first) and nothing came out when I squeezed.  I squeezed harder, and red liquid came out from all over, including under the threading of the cap. Some got into my glass, luckily.<br /><br />After cleaning the counter, my shirt, and the bottle, I tasted my water.  Not bad.  Fruit punch is not my favorite flavor, but this was definitely tasty and didn't have a diet aftertaste.  I hadn't put enough in my cup, so very carefully (and in the sink) I squirted again.  It works fine now - yay!<br /><br />The fact that you're supposed to refrigerate after opening makes a certain other water enhancing drink (I hate those commercials, but their product is pretty good) much easier to take to work.  My purse isn't refrigerated, so I'll probably finish this up at home.

It's got no calories, no sugar, no protein, no fat...  but it does give you something to actually taste. Unfortunately, it's not as great as I'd hoped.<br /><br />The bottle says all you need is one squeeze - well, to me, one squeeze is not enough - I could barely taste the flavoring. (This could be due to the fact that I'm a Southern gal, and our table wine is sweet - and I do mean *sweet* - tea.) Two squeezes seem to work best for me.<br /><br />The ""no mess"" claim is not entirely accurate either - for some reason, no matter how I hold the product, or cover my glass of water, some of it jumps out of the glass and onto the counter...necessitating a quick clean up.<br /><br />I'm also not crazy about some of the ingredients. Water is the first one (good); then a few down is sucralose, an artificial sweetener; then sodium benzoate, a food preservative and antifungal agent; and glyceryl abietate, an additive used as a stabilizer to keep oils in suspension in water (i.e. varnishes, paints, and cellulosic lacquers).  So... not exactly all vitamin, all healthy.<br /><br />Also, although I've had the product for a while now, I have to actually remember to use it. I don't automatically think ""oh boy, time for my vitamin squeeze"".

There is an aftertaste that I'm sure is a result of the sucralose.  If I had known that this product contained sucralose I wouldn't have ordered it, but I couldn't find any ingredients listed on the product page.<br /><br />The packaging is convenient.  It would be easy to pack this in a bag and carry it with you to squirt into drinks throughout the day.  That is...if you can stand the taste.",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"Surprised it needed refrigeration This review is based on a sample bottle provided through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I drink a lot of flavored water.  From Mio, to Nuun, to Crystal Light, and the store brands, I've tried most of them.  This one sounded pretty interesting.  Upon receiving the bottle, I stuck it in my bag to take to work.  When I went to use it for the first time, I looked at the back to see how much to use.  I was quite surprised to find it needed to be refrigerated after opening.  Back home it went, where it could be refrigerated.<br /><br />I find the flavor to be good.  You can actually taste the pineapple, and maybe some banana (although there's not banana in the picture.)  Like most of these things, getting the mix can be tricky.  After a few attempts, I've figured it out.  I think I'm using more than the squirt per 8oz, but that's ok.<br /><br />I don't usually feel caffeine (unless I drink a lot) so I can't really tell if this would affect a normal person.  The price seems high, but I don't really know how much you get from 12 oz of mix, compared to a box of pre-measured powders.  If a squirt is half an ounce, this is about twice as expensive as Crystal Light.  Of course the fact that it needs refrigeration may imply that it's a little more real than its competition.<br /><br />It's good enough that I might try the other flavors.",0,1

I had to use twice the recommended amount to get the desired sweetness and flavor. Otherwise it was like drinking plain water.<br /><br />CONVENIENCE -- 4 stars. I do like the convenience of this.

It's a good thing that there are some vitamins in this. Any little bit helps.<br /><br />CAFFEINE -- 3 stars. Does there really need to be caffeine in it? I am not sensitive to caffeine so for me it doesn't matter much, but I can imagine a lot of people don't want extra caffeine in their flavored drinks.<br /><br />So, overall I give it 3 stars.

B006MONQMC,"Energy, Sucralose and Fake Cherry Flavors I'm all for energy drinks and occasionally will need that extra push to get through the late afternoon. Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, is not a horrible product overall. I have felt more energetic for about the last week (which is the time period I've been using it) and that's probably due to the vitamins. There's not really that much caffeine in this, so the effect overall is mild.<br /><br />However, that said, the two things that bother me about this product are the flavor and the use of Sucralose.<br /><br />The flavor is reminiscent of Vicks Cherry cough syrup, IMO. Not exactly refreshing and very artificial-tasting. What cherries and punch would taste like if they were made of out plastic.<br /><br />The use of Sucralose is a little disturbing for something that purports to be healthy. Why not use stevia, an all-natural sweetener instead? Zero calories and very sweet, but not man-made and you don't get these fun side affects(from Wikipedia): ""A Duke University study found evidence that doses of Splenda of between 100 and 1000 mg/kg, containing sucralose at 1.1 to 11 mg/kg (compare to the FDA Acceptable Daily Intake of 5 mg/kg), reduced the amount of good bacteria in the intestines of rats by up to 50%, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight, and affected the levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)""  OK, I'm not a rat, but still, that is kind of a negative in my book.<br /><br />So, energy: 5 stars<br /><br />Flavor: Minus -.5 stars<br />Sucralose ingredient: -.5 stars",1,0

It will last many times longer than a small bottle of Mio.<br />The flavor is lovely. It really tastes fruity-not like a kids fake fruit flavored drink. I like that theres plentyof vitamin C. Not crazy about the ""natural caffeine"" but I can overlook that.  Hopefully other favors will come caffeine free.<br />One thing to point out-the bottle is much easier to squeeze than Mio.

It is fortified with various vitamins such as C and the B series, and electrolytes, with zero calories, sugar and carbohydrates.  I found its taste to be too sweet that I opted to dilute it in half with freshly squeezed orange juice; the punch's taste was still quite sweet even after I had diluted it. Others, however, may feel differently about the drink's taste. Without a doubt, it is a worthy addition to energy boosting drinks of which Gatorade may be the best known - and best loved - example.

My beef, and low star rating, is for the poor design of the bottle (at least the one I got as a sample). That thing was a hot mess.

I thought it would be one that my 9-year old son and I could both use. The mix has a sweet fruit punch flavor if you follow the recommended dilution, but getting that squeeze just right is sometimes tricky. Although it seemed like a good idea to have a large bottle that you could adjust flavor levels and for a reasonably good cost.  It is just harder to execute in actuality than in design.  My son would squeeze to much and we went through a cycle of add a little more water then a little more mix...<br /><br />My biggest complaint and the reason I wouldn't use this product regularly is for the caffeine content.

I didn't really notice a boost in energy, but I usually don't with these things. My one bad note is that I wouldn't have this shipped to you unless you're going to use the speed shipping.

As others have mentioned, the caffeine level is questionable, but I think that's alright.  Mixing caffeine, vitamins, and water seems like a futile effort because of caffeine's diuretic characteristics.<br /><br />Flavor: It tastes somewhere between Fruit Punch Kool-Aid and Hawaiian Punch.

B006MONQMC,"Good, Can Be Messy, Perfect Caffeine Level I always have enjoyed the powdered water enhancers. I have no trouble meeting my daily water intake goals (minus milk and V8, water is all I drink), but I like to get the added Vitamins products like Crystal Light provide, particularly when I am working out. The problem with those powdered mixes is that many of them do not mix well on the fly. Some of the Crystal Light variations do (the immunity enhancing kind does) while others that I like (the protein and fiber one) do not. When they don't and all you have is a water bottle to shake at your disposal, the clumping action at the bottom is a bit irritating as much of the powder stays there despite vigorous shakes.<br /><br />All of this is why I think the Vitamin Squeeze is really handy. The fact that you could take this and pre-squirt it into a water bottle as you head out for a walk or off to work is quite handy. I used to take Crystal Light to work with me and then pour it in my water bottle and have a real hassle mixing it without bringing along my long-handled spoon from home. With this product you could leave it in a work fridge and never have to think twice about it. Very handy.<br /><br />I also like the Vitamin mix it provides and don't mind the little bit of caffeine. According to the caffeine chart on my Bigelow teas...the 40 mg per serving is about the equivalent of a cup of green tea (which contains far less caffeine than coffee).<br /><br />The only other thing I can say about it is that my husband must have let a little bit pool around the hinge on the lid last night and that some of it ended up on our linoleum counter top. I scrubbed it to my usual level with dishwater and there is still a bit of the coloring left on the counter.

This Vitamin Squeeze energy drink is a good idea, but there are several problems I have with it. First, we need something without the caffeine. Being older and with a heart patient and a seizure-prone individual in the family, we are trying to cut way down on caffeine. Anyone with kids (the group the Fruit Punch flavor seems to be targeted to) is also not going to want the caffeine. The large bottle is a good thing until you realize you should use it up within 30 days. You'd need active, thirsty kids with friends or a large family to consume it all within the use-by date.<br /><br />The vitamins are what we are after and a healthier alternative to sodas. Specifically, we want a go-to drink that helps us wean ourselves off of diet sodas and get in the habit of reaching for water instead. (Those with soda-addicted children are probably looking for the same thing.) That's a tastebud issue as well as one of habit, just like cutting salt out of one's diet is&mdash;you start with more and then lessen the amount you use as your taste buds adjust. But the sucralose sweetener, as it is with many of these flavored-water drinks, is dreadful at any strength, IMO.<br /><br />I know, too, that the idea that sucralose is bad for you is controversial, but the taste of it is not. It has an indisputable chemical taste that I am not fond of. Why not Stevia instead? Or xylitol (with a caution about overconsumption causing diarrhea). The product has to be refrigerated, so why not something other than the shelf-stable sucralose?<br /><br />Finally, I'm confused about the ""one squeeze"" claim. I got the impression that this ""one squeeze"" is a measured amount. However, when I did one squeeze in a glass, it did not stop squeezing before I did and I wound up with a glass that was too strongly flavored and yucky. Is this how most people like their drinks? There seems to be some kind of control mechanism in the open portion of the cap, and also it looks like there is some kind of straw thing being used in the picture on the bottle. Is a straw thing required to measure/control the squeezer? My bottle (just one, for review) did not come with anything like that. So all I can say about it is that the squeeze does not seem to be measured. Maybe I misunderstood that it was going to be.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Punch (Water Enhancer) w/ Poor Taste Ok, I admit it. At first I just thought this was an energy drink and not a water enhancer. Drank some straight up thought it tasted nasty. Then took a peek at the reviews and realized you're supposed to only give a squirt to 8 oz. of water. Did that and it tasted less strong but still not pleasant. I like fruit punch as a flavor, but the taste of this leaves a lot to be desired. The flavor of Hawaiian Punch is hugely better than this. Tried giving another squirt, and it still tasted weak and unappealing. I see it's got some Vitamin C and B vitamins as well as caffeine in it. And, as has been mentioned by others, this container is not easy to open. I recently injured my right arm, and that certainly didn't help any. You have to slice into the top a bit, and then screw off the cap to find a seal that is quite hard to peel off. Like breaking into Fort Knox!

You get your caffeine, taurine(and heavy dose of vitamin B), as well as electrolytes in just one squeeze.  But now to put it against the gauntlet and grade it accordingly:<br /><br />-Coffee:  I know I'm not the only person who feels that this is an irreplaceable morning staple.  Although if you only drink coffee for the morning jolt of caffeine than this could be a fine substitute.  For me it's the taste and having something warm to start the day(particularly during our extended east coast winters). D+(God forbid I'm out of coffee some morning and running late, this could pinch hit for a morning I suppose.)<br />-Sports Drinks:  Again, an absolute must.  I play allot of sports so my trunk is filled with these at any given time. A(Refreshing with a good flavor, also less syrupy than many sport drinks.)<br />-Energy Drinks:  I don't do them.  Personally I feel like the ramifications of jamming several of these down your throat daily(as many of my friends and co-workers do) has yet to truly reveal itself... I very well could just be paranoid though. C(I'm fairly ignorant when it comes to these but I think the carbonation is part of the allure that many energy drinks hold, you won't find that here.  This is a zero carb alternative that some may enjoy.)<br /><br />That's not a horrible set of grades(and very common for any report card I've ever received), although I think the obvious application for this is if you lead a active life(i.e. sports, jogging, hiking) and want to spice up your water bottle.

The bottle claims that one serving satisfies 130% of your daily requirement for vitamin C, which is great.  The problem is, the ""energy"" you're likely to feel after chugging a bottle of VITAMIN SQUEEZE-flavored water comes from the ""natural caffeine,"" rather than from any vitamins.<br /><br />I'm not sure what ""natural caffeine"" is (it seems like an oxymoron to me!), but it's not something most health-conscious people are looking for in their vitamin drinks.  That was enough to turn me off to the product.  Add to that the intense amount of red food coloring (a tiny bit of the stuff dripped on my hand and I had three very red fingers) and you have another reason to pass on it.  As others have said, the bottle does tend to leak, which means this bright red substance is very likely to end up on your hands, clothing, or carpet.<br /><br />That said, it does taste like fruit punch, and I do like the concept behind the product -- you can adjust the amount of flavor, which makes it very convenient (unfortunately, the label states that the product should be refrigerated after opening, which means you can't just throw it into your gym bag or keep it in your locker or desk drawer).

Maybe this does appeal to American taste-buds, since I noticed a lot of reviewers said they liked the flavor-- taste is highly subjective.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze would certainly be a healthier alternative to diet colas, the minimal packaging and water-basing are environmentally sensitive, and the portable format (""just add water"") has some appeal.

Often, I find it hard to control the quantity, and under-flavoring makes the drink taste like a flat soda, whereas over flavoring is just too sweet. This larger bottle, however, seems to give just the right amount of flavor if you use two fingers to squeeze until it becomes too hard to squeeze anymore, and the spout seals tight and effectively to prevent drips and spills. The overall flavor is your typical fruit punch-y flavor, and there is only that faintest hint of chemicals to suggest the caffeine, taurine and vitamins it contains. The pick-up it provides is mild, I'd say about the same as a cup of coffee or can of diet soda. I don't think the other stuff in it is particularly strong or useful to my body as far as recovery times, strength building, electrolyte supply, etc. Still, I use this as my flavoring of choice on rest and light workout days, with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X5FYJQ"">Optimum Nutrition Essential Amino Energy, Fruit Fusion, 30-Count</a> my ""go to"" drink on workout and hard running days.

I followed the directions and added two squirts to my 16 oz water bottle (one squirt for every 8 oz of water) and first of all, you need to empty some water from the bottle before you add this product or you'll overflow onto the counter and second, two squirts were too many. I feel one would have been sufficient. This is really sweet and tastes completely artificial and bad for you, which it is. If you're concerned about your health and feel the need for extra vitamins then I suggest getting a natural supplement from a trusted source. This isn't going to do you any good, in fact just the fact that it is full of Splenda and red dye is enough to make me run from this product.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"Very good! I love the taste, I love the packaging, I love the convenience, I love the vitamins -- it's all good! This is a super product to keep in the break room refrigerator and mix up just enough when I need it. There's no waste, because I can make it as strong or light as I wish.<br /><br />This is a good product that I will definitely purchase again and again.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Nice, mild flavor. I often add something to my bottled water when I work out, just to give it a little zip and zing. This product meets this need quite well.<br /><br />It produces a mild, light pleasant flavor that is neither sickly sweet nor chemical-tasting.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Good product but I don't like the bottle :p<br /><br />Product tasted great and I initially thought the bottle was great, squirt a few and you're good.  However, I left it standing as you see in the pic, and came back with product leaking/leaked out.  So that wasn't good.<br /><br />I like the taste and am in the camp that, no matter how healthy we eat, we need to supplement with vitamins/minerals be it in pill, powder or liquid form, your choice.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Cough Syrup Tasting Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer is a water flavoring system like Mio or other competitors. It has no calories, no carbs, and no sugar. How does it compare?<br /><br />First, the container. This is a fairly large container, a bit larger than a can of soda, for 24 servings. Other packages like the Mio are able to provide the same flavoring amount in a much smaller, purse-sized container. This Vitamin Squeeze also has to be refrigerated and used within 30 days. So that also makes it less of an easy to use product.<br /><br />It is true that it has no calories, no carbs, no fat, no sodium, no protein, and no sugar. It also provides 120% of your vitamin C, as well as 40% of your vitamin B6, B5, B3, and B12. So you are getting some vitamins here.<br /><br />Ingredient wise, you get water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, and then a pile of chemicals.<br /><br />But really, it all comes down to taste. My boyfriend and I have tested MANY water flavorings over the years, and this was just not good. It tasted like medicine. We experimented with different amounts, different techniques, and it simply was never as good as the many other options on the market. Even let's say we wanted to have Vitamin C in our diet. We'd gladly eat a chewy, tasty orange vitamin rather than have to drink this. There's really no up side to using this as an alternative.<br /><br />If there were no other water flavors at all available, and this was the only choice, then I might think about trying to get used to this flavor. But why would I, when there are delicious options out there? Not only are there options that taste far better, but they're far easier to use and don't require refrigeration.<br /><br />Of course, I will caveat that we all have different taste buds. Undoubtedly there will be some people who, for whatever reason, adore this flavor. That's fine. For them, this might be a good fit. After all there are people who adore the taste of cough syrup! So maybe that's a good way to judge. If you adore cough syrup and would drink it all the time, then this is probably to your liking. If not, then you probably want to try one of the many other options out there.<br /><br />I was provided a free sample to review by the maker.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"Not What it Appears to Be ""Rah-rah for this dose of sunshine, bursting with its delicious thirst-quenching combination of tropical fruit punches.""  .. or maybe not.<br /><br />Nutritious?  The implied claim is that it contains ""combination of tropical fruit punches."" There are no actual juices in the product.  It chemically flavored, artificially sweetened water. I do not consider myself a health food snob, but to call this nutritious is a stretch.  There are a few vitamins, but C is the only that is included at 100% of the RDA.  The others are less than 50%.  If it's vitamin you want, a multivitamin tablet would serve you much better.  The label touts that is provides ""electrolytes"" but the fine print says 0mg of sodium and that it is ""not a significant source"" of potassium. These are one of the two key electrolytes you want a drink to provide.<br /><br />Delicious? Whether this is delicious is probably a matter of opinion.  To me it tasted exactly like cherry Kool-Aid.  If you like that taste, and I don't, you might like this.<br /><br />Energy?  It contains 40mg of ""natural"" caffeine.  I've never heard of unnatural caffeine, so this is clearly an overstatement, to try to convince you of some health benefits.  Will 40 mg of caffeine give you an energy boost?  A standard cup of coffee can have 100 - 200mg of caffeine.  At Starbucks Grande has 300mg.  If a couple of sips of coffee give you an energy boost than this will too.  I did not feel any.<br /><br />Other Issues?  The bottle is double sealed.  An external wrapper seal, and an internally one that you have to pull off.  However, once opened, the bottle leaks, even with the cap on tight.  At least mine did.  What make it worse is this come out like bright red paint. I got some on my desk at work (plastic modular furniture, not wood) and it left a stain that I cannot get out.  I suspect that if you get this on clothing, it will be permanent.<br /><br />Overall I see nothing to recommend about this product.  I am also disappointed that the seem to be making claims that I feel are not backed up by the contents of this product.",-1,-1

No reason to be shy, or a worrry  about running out.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor is great for morning use, and will give you a ""lift"" , you can control the ""lift""  depending upon how many squirts you might prefer.<br /><br />It is also nice when nused with home soda makers ( or club soda...) and is sensational when added to an ice cube tray, and used in a blended fashion with product and water.<br /><br />I will be trying other flavors soon.  This is yummy, and it works!  One of the best new products I have tried this year.",1,1

B006MONQMC,"About average, could be a lot better. There's suddenly been a lot of these different squeeze bottle drink mix's for bottled water pop up on the market. Some are good, some not so good. The main point that these started with was being a mix concentrate in a ""SMALL"" squeeze bottle that is ""easy to carry with you"" and use anyplace anywhere. They decided not to make this one as concentrated so it needs to be a much larger bottle. And even though it is a large bottle of mix, it still only holds enough for 24 servings. The same as the little bottle that MIO uses. It says on the bottle to use one squirt for every 8oz. of water. But it's really hard to tell when to stop squeezing the thing. I think what ever it is in the bottle that measures how much to release at one time in my bottle is broken. It's really hard to tell just how much to use and it doesn't seem to really have much true Fruit Punch ""flavor"" to it. It sure doesn't taste like any fruit punch I've ever had. It reminds me a lot of the old artificially sweetened Kool-Aid that they came out with a long time ago and used Saccharin in. It has that same Saccharin after taste that kinda sticks in the back of the throat along with a little bit of that vitamin taste.<br />  This is one that I doubt very much that I will be buying any of it in the future. There's just to many others that have a lot better flavor and in a far smaller bottle that's easier to use and take with you. I really hate to say it, but this one just isn't up there where it can compete with what's already on the market and available. Some people might like it, but for me its that Saccharin sweet, almost gagging after taste that just stay's in the back of my throat and wont go away that I don't like the most.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"OK flavor, but requires you to use a lot of it to get any flavor. The flavor is OK but nothing special for this category of product.

It's either too weak or too strong,, but that's probably my fault adding the right amount for my taste. Still, the flavor, in my opinion,  is moderate at best. As for the energy, I understand it isn't an energy drink per se', but I've gotten more pep out of a can on Mointain Dew. However, it is nice that it's full of B vitamins and natural caffeine.

B006MONQMC,"A decent sugar substitute Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is a highly concentrated additive that can be mixed with water to create a sweet drink that gives you a does of vitamins as well.  The fruit punch flavor is pretty tasty and a much healthier alternative to the sports drinks and powdered sugar mixtures that are my usual.  The bottle is very handy indeed and is perfect for adding just the amount of flavor you desire.  The plastic bottle yields to pressure in small increments, allowing great control over how many squeezes os Vitamin Squeeze come out.  I find 1-2 squeezes for every cup of water is plenty. Has having a glass or two of VS-infused water (and occasionally lemonade, which is a DELICIOUS mixture) improved my health or energy?  Can't really say, but I've gotten a lot of mileage out of the small bottle I received so I'd have to say that it is worth it for somebody who primarily drinks water rather than the unhealthy sucrose-laden concoctions to try this product for the sake of having some variety of flavor and the bonus supplemental vitamin content.  But if you are happy with guzzling Pepsi, Red Bull, and Kool-Aid, then this is probably going to be a bit pricey for you.  My verdict on Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink: recommended for anybody on a health kick, but not so much if you are looking for an energy boost or something sugary to chug.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"A Nice Water Enhancer Water is nice and much healthier than the alternative but sometimes it is nice to have an extra kick to the plain water.  Vitamin Squeeze is different than other water additives because of, well, the vitamins.  It boasts Vitamins C, B3, B5, B6, and B12, Caffeine, something called Taurine and of course what drink these days would not complete with Electrolytes, whatever those are.  And it does seem to be working because I have notice I have not have as many of those mid-afternoon sluggish feeling since adding it to my lunch water and there is no crash associated from drinking.  It took me a little over a month of near daily use the whole bottle which is good because the packaging says for the best quality to use within thirty days after opening.<br /><br />With the vitamin Squeeze in the water, it kind of taste like the Gatoraide Fruit Punch.  But the biggest problem with the product is getting the right amount of additive into the water.  Not get enough in and the drink tastes watered down (naturally) and put too much in and it taste almost like medicine.  But unlike other water enhancers on the market which just sits in the bottom that you have to stir up, I never needed to stir the Vitamin Squeeze.  If you are looking for a little extra with your water, this is worth a try.",1,1

I really like that it's all natural, has zero calories, and zero carbs. There's also zero sugar added. It's a very light fruit punch flavor, which I really like since it's not overpowering and sugary like Kool-Aid. You only need one squeeze for a glass of water and the bottle design does make it pretty easy to be mess-free.<br /><br />Once opened, you have to keep it in the fridge, but it's so easy to keep this on your door and grab it every time you have a glass of water. I also use Emergen-C, but like this as an alternative because it's more of a light flavor.<br /><br />I can't wait to try some of the other flavors.",1,1
B006MONQMC,Tasty This liquid vitamin is pretty tasty. I thought it made my water taste like watered down Crystal Light.

The only downside is that it requires refrigeration after opening.,1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamin Squeeze Tastes Great When Added to Tonic Water and Ice! Update on June 23, 2012:  I just discovered that Vitamin Squeeze tastes great when added to tonic water and ice.  (See the photograph that I have posted on this website.)  It reminds me of the fruit punch one drinks at a reception for a wedding, graduation, anniversary or other special event.  Tonic water costs about the same as bottled water.  Buy the generic brand.  Tonic water is carbonated water that is usually sweetened with fructose corn syrup, the same sweetener that is used in fruit drinks.  Vitamin Squeeze and tonic water is still healthier than sodas.  The brand of tonic water that I buy has 90 calories per serving.<br /><br />*******************************<br /><br />I suffer from chronic sinusitis; therefore, I shouldn't drink carbonated sodas because they increase my sinus congestion.  Another good reason why I shouldn't drink them is because I am prone to cavities.  However, I get tired of drinking only water.  Fortunately, my dentist recommended that I drink flavored water.  Normally, I use the MIO Liquid Water Enhancers.  My favorite flavor is the MIO Sweet Tea [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY"">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].  It tastes like real ice tea whereas the other flavors remind me too much of the artificial, sugary-sweet Kool-Aid products I drank as a child [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ50U4"">Kool-aid Tropical Punch Soft Drink Mix, 82.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 2)</a>].<br /><br />  I was excited to receive the Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer from the Amazon Vine Program.  I'm been using it faithfully for over a month.  First of all, it reminds me very much of the MIO products.  However, whereas the MIO products are more travel-size, the Vitamin Squeeze is more suitable for home use.  Vitamin Squeeze's larger 12 ounce size is more economical than MIO's 1.62 ounces.  I work at a shipyard where the water tastes foul.  I usually bring my own drinking water into the office.  I purchase various sizes of Deer Park water as shown in the photograph I've posted on this website.  Before I leave home for work, I squirt three drops of the Vitamin Squeeze into the 500 ml bottle or five drops into the 750 ml one.  The fruit punch flavor is a pleasant respite; however, when my bottle of Vitamin Squeeze is empty, I plan on buying the peach green tea flavor [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQP4"">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Peach Green Tea, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].<br /><br />  Unlike soft drinks, a serving of Vitamin Squeeze has 120% RDA of Vitamin C.  (A serving size equals one squeeze per eight ounces of water.)  Vitamin C is a natural antibiotic that boosts your immune system and helps ward off flus and colds and fight infections, such as a sinus infection.  Each serving also has 40 mg of caffeine which is about equal to that of a soft drink.  However, instant coffee has 65 to 100 mg of caffeine per eight ounce serving; brewed coffee has 80 to 135 mg; and Starbucks Grande Coffee (16 oz) has a hefty 330 mg.  The Vitamin Squeeze has Vitamins B6, B5, B3 and B12 (40% RDA of each), which give you energy.  Honestly, I haven't noticed any difference in my energy levels since drinking this product.  If you want to increase your energy level, the best thing you can do is get more sleep at night.  There are also zinc and chromium (10% RDA), which also boost your immune system.  Like Gatorade, the Vitamin Squeeze also contains electrolytes which aid in recuperation after exercising, especially jogging.<br /><br />  I store my Vitamin Squeeze in my refrigerator in order to maintain freshness.  The first couple of weeks I noticed red stains on the bottom of the refrigerator shelf.  However, using a soapy sponge, I was able to easily wipe them away.  The bottle is comfortable to grip while quickly squirting drops into the Deer Park containers.  I cap the bottles and shake them and the water enhancer is easily dispersed throughout the water.  There is not a horrible aftertaste.  I am reminded of the Kool-Aid I drunk as a child.  Nevertheless, the Vitamin Squeeze is a healthier, more economical alternative to soft drinks.  It is good to use in large bottles of water that you plan to take to work, church or the gym.  Bottled water always comes in handy when I'm walking through my apartment complex or rehearsing in choir.  (I've also sipped on water that was enhanced with Vitamin Squeeze while I relaxed in a bubble bath.)  It is wise to keep a bottle of Vitamin Squeeze at home and at work.  For traveling to restaurants, church, social gatherings, etc., then I recommend the smaller MIO products; they fit easier inside one's purse or backpack.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamins, flavor and caffeine. What more could you want? Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)<br /><br />If you've ever tried a Mio you get the idea of what this product is. It is a liquid that you squeeze into a water bottle to flavor up the water and add some benefits. In this case you get some Vitamin C and a whole bunch more vitamins and caffeine. That last one is a deal breaker for a lot of people. Why they included it is a choice they made. If you want the extra jolt, you can have it; if not maybe the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4ADKU"">MIO Fruit Punch, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> product is better.<br /><br />As far as taste, it's OK. The idea of a ""squeeze"" as a measure is not an easy thing to replicate. First you need room in the bottle you're squeezing into. It the bottle has too much water, better sip a bit off the top. It seems this product needs more liquid added then the Mio to get a similar strength. Then again the bottle is about four times as large as the signature Mio bottle. Not very portable, it's more for home use. It also needs refrigeration after opening. I added what I thought was a good squeeze and wound up with a dark pink colored drink. It tasted OK, sort of like a red Popsicle. I wanted more so after drink it down a bit I added more to get a more red, red. This tasted better to me, more fruit punchy.<br /><br />Over all I liked it but thought the Mio was a better choice for portability and concentration. It's still a good choice to have around the house for a quick boost of vitamins and flavor. Also, a bit of caffeine if you so desire.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Yuck I drink a lot of Mio's fruit punch, and I thought I'd give this a try, combining the calorie free flavoring along with much needed vitamin C.<br /><br />It disappointed.<br /><br />The flavor is somewhat fruity, but not particularly close to the usual ""fruit punch"" flavor.  The taste of the added vitamins is more pronounced than anything but sweet.  It leaves an unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth too.<br /><br />I use water flavoring to encourage more consumption of water, but this bombed out.  It doesn't help that it requires refrigeration either--I like to take the flavoring with me to add to water wherever I am, whether bottled water or tap water. The container is as large as a baby bottle, and it takes a larger quantity of this flavoring to do the trick than that of Mio.<br /><br />I'll stick to Mio for its refrigerator-free portability, small containers, and higher concentration of flavor.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"I will stay with Mio.  Strong artificial taste I have tried many different types of water flavoring products, I was looking forward to trying another option.  My current favorite is Mio but is a little pricey if you do not get it on sale.<br /><br />The idea of adding flavor and maintaining 0 calories is also a bonus.  In order to get the flavor to my liking it takes multiple squeezes otherwise it tastes like a badly watered down kool-aid.<br /><br />The aftertaste of the flavoring is what I do not care for.  I realize the product artificial but it does not have to taste so artificial. If this was the only option on the market it is good enough to overcome this taste but with so many options I would not recommend this to friends and family.",-1,0

Just a few squirts and I would have favor-enhanced water on the go.<br /><br />I received the Fruit Punch flavor to sample.

B006MONQMC,Taste pretty good It tasted good and was easy to use. If you used too much it didnt taste very good and was best when mixed with other things. I liked it especially with diet 7-up.

It also will stain easily but if you are drinking any red beverage that should be expected. All in this was pretty good.,1,1
B006MONQMC,"Nice change from diet sodas At least Vitamin Squeeze has added nutrition.  My first impression was that there was a slight tang to the fruit punch flavor, and there is a subtle aftertaste.  However the aftertaste is not overpowering.  I tried it in 12 ounces of cold water and it took two squeezes to make it sweet enough for me.  I noticed some other reviewers were saying they're allowing their kids to drink this.  It's clearly written on the label that it's not for kids due to the high caffeine content.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes good, zero calories, nice kick of energy. The popularity of liquid concentrates, to add to water or seltzer, has been a god-send.

It also has zero calories, which can make it a great asset for dieting or cutting down.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink comes in an easy flip-top container; meant to be refrigerated after opening. It tastes fairly good, and has a good vitamin matrix: Vitamin C, B Complex, some caffeine, and a few other goodies.<br /><br />Now, the container itself instructs consumers to not use it in mixed drinks or in conjunction with alcohol but -- lettuce be cereal -- the stuff is made to be added to club soda and vodka.

B006MONQMC,"Dreadful stuff We've used Mio and Crystal Light varieties of water enhancers and were excited to try something new.  Unfortunately, you must use a lot of this enhancer in order to adequately flavor your drink and even then it tastes an awful lot like bad Gatorade.  The fruit punch flavor is not very appealing and the resulting deep red beverage is so thick with food coloring that you can't see through it.  Stain city waiting to happen.  Maybe we're spoiled by Mio since a little of it goes such a long way your water still resembles water after you've flavored it.  You get a much bigger bottle with the Vitamin Squeeze but that's because you have to use so much of it.  It's just not very pleasant to drink.  We couldn't finish the bottle.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Good Product but not for Me Vitamin Squeeze Energy drink tastes like a child's version of artificial fruit punch. It does provide more flavor to plain water but still not entirely sure that I'd choose it over lemon mixed with water. The directions say one squeeze per 8 ounces of water but depending on the pressure applied, you will get more or less with each application. Too little tastes bad and squeezing longer or with more pressure may go over the recommended dosage. Warning: this does effect the color of your urine.<br /><br />Also the purity of where these vitamins are obtained are questionable. We all know that  obtaining vitamins and minerals from whole food sources are the best, preferably unprocessed & raw/organic. Overall, I don't think I'd purchase this product because I did not notice more energy and it does interfere with my recommended daily vitamin intake, I could be over dosing!",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Just add a tiny bit... Wow, this stuff is sweet!  I would only add a tiny bit.  It has a distinctive fruit punch (think kids artificial not actual fruit) flavor and we didn't notice any extra energy from it.  I did let the kids try a sip & my 5 year old thought it was ""good & sweet (this was with very little added)"" but didn't want any more.  It has to be refrigerated once opened and is much larger than it's competitor Mio (about 4 times larger).  That said, I'm not a huge fruit punch fan so if you are this may be what you are looking for.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"Like this product a lot I would have given this product 5 stars except for 2 problems: the description wasn't clear about which vitamins are in it, and there's no easy way to know if you've mixed the right amount of product in your water.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good for a vitamin drink. Yes, it has a slight vitamin taste but maybe I'm adding too much? The punch flavor isn't too sweet or overpowering. I really feel an energy boost when I drink this, so I'm sold on it. I also like that the bottle doesn't drip AT ALL when I use it, and it stands up flat on its flip top cap.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only vitamins in it are C and several B's. Wish it had more or that I had known what was in it when I ordered it. Also, the directions say 1 ""squeeze"" per 8 oz water. How big of a squeeze? I have big strong hands. Are my squeezes delivering too much or too little vitamins to equal the ingredient statement? The bottle has little hashmarks on the outside wrapper that I assume measre a one ounce serving, but the bottle is totally opaic  - so ummmm how can you see what you use? If it wasn't a  vitamin supplement I wouldn't make a big deal of it. But this isn't a flavor-to-taste product so I think it's an important point.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"water with a murk to it is not my thing recently, i have been trying to find ways to get energy during the day that doesn't come from caffeine or soda. so when i saw this product, i thought i would give it a go. i tried it one morning in a bottle of water and i felt like i was drinking the dregs of melted ice cubes from a fruit flavroed beverage like kool-aid or crystal light. to add to this, i didn't feel the least bit energized. so i had my morning coffee a little later. i don't think this product is a total fail. a shot in a glass of orange juice might do a body wonders for waking up in the morning.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Good on-the-go alternative to regular energy drinks This is a decent alternative to the traditional canned energy drinks. I don't think it's going to replace my preferred brand, but I still think I'll keep one of these in the fridge anyway. You basically squeeze some of this concentrated stuff into your water, stir it up, and you're done: your water has become a non-carbonated energy drink. The taste is comparable to Kool-Aid - in other words, it's not horrible, but it's far from great and has that fake sugary juice taste, but then again I don't think many people drink energy drinks for the taste so, well, I can deal with it for the convenience. You can decide your own dosage, so if you want it to be stronger squeeze in some more and if you want less you can make it a bit weaker. You can mix this in a glass of ice water and stir, or you can open a bottle of water, take a sip, squeeze in some of this stuff, close up the bottle and shake it, and you're done. In terms of the level of energy you get from these, your mileage will obviously vary, especially because you're in control of the dosage yourself here. I personally like this for when I'm not up for a full energy drink. I especially like it because I can mix up a bottle and then carry it around all day: I take a travel bottle, fill it to the top with ice, squeeze in some of this stuff and then fill the rest up with water. It's non-carbonated so it doesn't go flat, and the ice keeps it cool for a long time. It's very convenient, and I can forgive the Kool-Aid flavor because of that convenience.<br />(Word of warning: when you squeeze, the liquid jets out pretty strongly, so be careful - this stuff is very concentrated and bright red, you don't want it on your clothes. It splashes even worse if you squeeze it right onto ice, so again, just be aware when you fix your drink so you don't end up with bright red splatters on your clothing!)",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes great, seems to be healthy with Vitamins, cap has issues Squeeze this into a glass of cold water makes a nice refreshing drink. All four of us like the taste - it is a lighter punch taste with no sugar or carbs. Don't mind taking vitamins this way.<br /><br />However the screw-top has some issues. After squeezing out once, I accidently put in the frig top down. The liquids leaked around the screw-top, but the seal at the mouth was fine.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"SodaStream alternative The flavor is labeled as fruit punch, and it bears a resemblance to Hi-C Fruit Punch, but not as sugary. With the recommended mixture, it tastes like watered-down Hi-C. If you add more, it tastes fruitier without becoming overly sweet. However, it doesn't taste very natural, again like Hi-C. There are no discernible fruit flavors. It's a vague sort of fruitiness, like Vitamin Water Zero.<br /><br />I also tried it with my SodaStream. The carbonation dulls taste buds, so the soda water needs a lot of syrup for full flavor.<br /><br />It claims to be an energy drink, but I didn't notice any boost in my energy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: All in all, it's not bad, but it's not great. For people who dislike plain water, this makes it less boring without overwhelming you with fruit flavors or sugary sweetness. But if you need energy or something sweet, you should buy a can of soda-pop.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: It was suggested to me that it might be okay for masking the off-flavors of cheap vodka. Not really my thing, but feel free to try.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Bland and blander I can't fault the vitamin content, though I didn't necessarily feel an exhilirating boost after drinking it.  The problem for me was simply the fact that the flavor just isn't there.  There weren't enough squeezes in the bottle to make it worth my while.",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"Average Getting in your vities while quenching your thirst is a nice idea. Appreciation of flavor varies from person to person, but I thought that this punch flavor was ok. A definite minus is the bottle itself. There is no such thing as dependable dosing and it does not lock tightly after repeated use. For those insisting on ""natural"" the inclusion of food coloring and sucralose may be a problem.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Defective bottle, staining red liquid I'm not sure if it was just my bottle that was defective, but the squeeze forced liquid out all over, spraying this highly-staining red liquid all over me, my counter, sink, etc. And trust me - it will stain anything it comes into contact with, including skin!  So frustrating.  On the positive side, it is tasty, reminds me of Kool Aid or Hi C, and I am glad that it does not contain aspartame. With this type of ""sports/energy"" drink, however, I do prefer actual sugar to feed my body while I am walking/running/hiking/working out.  (Sucralose is the sweetener used in this product.) The caffeine is a mild boost, 40mg per ""squeeze.""  You can adjust the squeeze to use as much or as little as you'd like, according to your taste and water bottle size (provided that your Vitamin Squeeze bottle is not defective).",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Strange Fruit Punch Kind of a weird fruit punch taste.  It's as if they haven't mastered the formula or the other ingredients are affecting the normal fruit punch taste.  The bottle squirts easily into a cup, and I've had no problems with leaks yet.  I've detected a little kick from this product so it does help a little.  Honestly I think tea has about the same kick for me compared to this product, and tea doesn't taste so artificial.  Price seems a little high too.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"sugary kool-aid In my opinion, you have to have a taste for this kind of drink. My wife tasted it and really didn't care for it. It definitely wouldn't be my first pick for an energy drink. It reminds me of an energy drink that we had for our football team. So, I would say you can definitely develop a taste for it if your willing to take the time for it. I wouldn't say it gave me a boost but to some it might. I wouldn't waste money on it again. Save the money and buy some  kool-aid.",0,-1
B006MONQMC,"Synthetic tasting, great packaging I thought this might would be a good, economical way to zazz up tap water or fizzy water. I like that it has vitamins & electrolytes, and that it has a lot of servings in a wee little package, making it very conveinient on fridge space. It was easy to dispense, includes a serving indicator on the side, and mixed in easily. But I found the flavor to be flat and synthetic tasting. I love diet coke, but that's about the limit to artifical sweeteners in my diet, so this might be a good choice if you drink a lot of artificially sweetened fruit drinks. However, if you only dabble in artifical sweeteners, you may find this bland, flat, and really fake tasting, like me.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"good alternative to soda Vitamin Squeeze is an innovative all-natural water additive that infuses flavor, vitamins, and caffeine.  The bottle contains 24 squeezes which makes 24 8 ounce glasses of water.  Compared to similar vitamin infused water, you are saving about 50 cents per 16 oz bottle.<br />The fruit punch flavor tastes similar to sugar free kool-aid.  It is sweetened with sucralose and the ascorbic acid from the Vitamin C.  The concentrate is red and will stain your clothes and hands if you don't wash them right away.<br />Each 8 oz serving contains 120% Vitamin C, 40% Vitamins B6, B5, B3, and B12, and 10% chromium and zinc.<br />Does it really give you energy?  Hard to say, because so many other things can factor in, but I drink this at lunch and I do feel like I get a boost through the afternoon.  I have replaced my lunch time diet pop with this which I believe is a healthier alternative.<br />Overall this is a really cool product and healthy alternative to other energy drinks and pops.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Good product, bad bottle The most important thing about this product is the flavour, so I'll knock out that first.  The initial comparison Vitamin Squeeze will draw in taste is to Kool Aid (and other fruit punches).  It actually tastes quite a bit like the regular red Kool-Aid, but not as sugary and nauseating.  It has a nice, pleasant Kool-Aid taste when used with the ""recipe"" on the bottle (which is one squeeze for every cup (8 oz) of water).<br /><br />The sweet taste is especially good for this reason: It's actually beneficial in a nutritional sense.  According to the label, Vitamin Squeeze contains 120% of your daily intake of Vitamin C along with different types of Vitamin B, Taurine, and electrolytes (like in Gatorade).  For this, it could be a good replacement to the typical fruit punches, sports drinks, etc., that so many kids have.  Vitamin Squeeze doesn't have all of the sugar and calories that those drinks have (which are some of the worst things you can give a kid).<br /><br />The label, in addition to the vitamin benefits, also claims some energy-drink qualities.  Well, it does have ""natural caffeine,"" but don't expect to get a Red Bull kick or anything like that.  I did notice an upkick in my post workout recovery though.  It may have been placebo, but it's worth noting if you want to treat this like a Gatorade replacement to replenish electrolytes after intense workouts.<br /><br />Now, for my only negative issue with Vitamin Squeeze: The bottle.  I'm hoping I received a dud with the packaging because, from the very beginning, it leaked from under the cap and left what looked like drips of blood all over my floor & countertops.  Since I do plan on trying this product again in the future, I'll update further if I have better or the same packaging.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Nothing to Write Home About This seems like a decent enough idea. Squeeze your vitamins into your water bottle in delicious liquid form.<br /><br />I found that there is no clear definition of what a ""squeeze"" was, and considering that it involves vitamins that have clear daily recommended amounts AND caffeine, I would prefer that it be more clear about what a squeeze is.<br /><br />Taste-wise, it's ok, but nothing memorable that would bring me back for more. Also, if you prefer that your water taste more like juice, you will need more than one squirt of this product to accomplish that desire.<br /><br />Keep in mind that it needs to be refrigerated after opening, so it's not really portable.<br /><br />All in all, it's decent, but not anything to write home about.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Drinking water has never been this enjoyable and satisfying I am now a huge fan of water enhancers. The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch certainly adds delight to this never ending ritual which is so vital to life. I drink water often, more than the recommended daily intake, especially while working out. Having added nutrients to your water makes this more of a conscious effort. Although water by itself is sustaining enough, knowing what you are drinking is packed with nutrients makes you appreciate it more. The packaging is pretty convenient too (worth mentioning). The squeeze bottle is made in such a way that it ""responds"" to a gentle squeeze, delivering enough of the liquid to enhance your drinking water. I have this both at home and at work, totally taking an ordinary endeavor to new heights! Highly recommended!",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Enjoyable, but packaging is a another story In general, I am not a big fan of the recent ""squeeze"" drink concentrate fad. I have found most of them to have a slightly-off, artificial taste (one exception: Mio Sweet Tea). However, I find that ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce"" is the exception to the rule. Vitamin rich, it has a very pleasant taste that belies its sugar-free status.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to take the rating of this product down a notch for its packaging. It is extremely easy to dribble and leak if squeezed in the wrong manner, and the coloring is prone to staining. Also, the bottle size is larger than comparable drink products, such as Mio, meaning that it is not the most portable squeeze drink product around.<br /><br />In all, ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce"" is definitely worth picking up for its taste, which is pretty much the best I've had of its kind. Too bad about the packaging, though.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Best tasting stuff yet I really prefer this to Mio.  It puts a little splash of flavor into your drink, and it has some essential vitamins to boot, to include Electrolytes (it's what plants crave), 10 mg taurine, 10 mg caffeine, 40% each of B1, B5, B6, and B12, and 120% Vitamin C.  NO SUGAR!  I got this stuff mainly for the ENERGY component - i've been working long hours and am not a big fan of coffee, and soda in the morning just doesn't taste the same.  This is a great alternative, tastes sort of like Kool-Aid without the 2 cups of sugar.  However, I don't find the Energy boost to be very substantial.  It has slightly less caffeine per serving than the average soda, and about half the caffeine than a cup of coffee.  I would not rely on this as an energy boost, unless maybe you were to squeeze in 5 servings into a bottle of water.<br /><br />As an added benefit, I also use this stuff in water to give to my kid when they ask for juice.  She really likes it, and can't tell the difference.  I have always had sensitive/weak teeth, so I try to keep sugars out of her diet as much as I can, so the fact that I can give her juice without her knowing it is a great thing, plus it's easy to transport and give to her on-the-go.  All you need is a water bottle and the Vitamin Squeeze!  Plus, I don't find any more fermented apple juice sippy cups in the back of my car anymore!<br /><br />MY ONLY ISSUE with this product (hence the 4-star review) is the function of the bottle.  It seems clean and easy, but the design is flawed.  The bottle is designed to be stored upside-down.  The problem is that the nozzle leaks.  When the cap is closed, no product will come out, so it's not like it will seep out of its container altogether; however, when inverted, the gravity causes small amounts of product to ooze out of the nozzle and into the cap.  Then, when you open the cap, that oozed product drips out (because you have it inverted) and lands on your floor or counter.  Well, the first time this happened, i got some on my hardwood floor and my cheap, laminate countertop.  The dog cleaned the stuff from the floor, and I was too lazy to wipe the stuff off the counter.  Later on, when I tried to clean it off the counter, I found that no amount of cleaner or scrubbing would completely remove the red splotch from the surface.  I spilled it again in a different spot, and cleaned it up immediately.  There is still a visible splotch, but it's not red in color.  I don't know why this stuff stains so quickly and so well, but it's a problem.  It's easily fixed by storing the bottle upright.<br /><br />If anyone has any suggestions on a homemade concoction that will take out a red stain from a countertop, please let me know.  Maybe I can get Ecosentials, LLC (the maker of this product) get buy me new countertops?",1,1

B006MONQMC,I guess its O.K. The Fruit punch flavor of this water flavoring featuring  Vitamin C  is O.K. though it took quite a bit more product than the instructions called for to give any noticeable fruit punch flavor to the water. I noticed a distinct bitter chemical aftertaste which was not the taste I usually get from vitamin C. I am one of those people who can taste some things that most people can not taste and some of my family members did not find this product bitter and some did. I really like the idea of a water enhancer that includes vitamin C but this particular product was not one I enjoyed enough to continue drinking.,0,0

A lot of the reason, I like these drinks is to change up the water routine without consuming caffeine.  The size of this container is good...much bigger than Mio.  It is overall a good value.  You should know it contains caffeine but if that doesn't bother you, then it is a good product at a good value.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"The taste just wasn't there for me I consume vitamin drinks pretty regularly. I just couldn't get into the taste of this product. It was a bit bland and I wasn't comfortable with the amount I had to use to make it taste ""right"" in my water. Even after 2 1/2 squeezes it still tasted like a powder drink with no sugar added. I was really hoping for a better experience.<br />I also wasn't too happy with the ingredient list:<br />Water, Citric Acid, Vitamin C, Natural Flavor, Sucralose, Natural Caffeine, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Magnesium Lactate, Gluconate Vitamin B3, Taurine, Vitabin B5, Calcium Lactate, Gum Acacia, Glyceryl, Abietate, Red 40, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12<br /><br />I think they should have added 10 calories and went with a more natural sugar to kick up the flavor a bit.<br /><br />For those that are okay with drinking just water and just want to add some vitamins to the experience - this may be the product for you.

B006MONQMC,"I'll Stick with MiO, Thanks Well following in the footsteps of the successful MiO comes Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. From a practical standpoint Vitamin Squeeze has a lot going for it. All you need is some water, squirt in some Vitamin Squeeze and bada bing, you now have an energy drink. The drink additive boasts zero calories, zero carbs, and zero sugar. That alone is pretty impressive coming from something labeled as an energy drink. Then of course Vitamin Squeeze is loaded with a fair share of vitamins and I suppose that could be a big benefit for the right consumer.<br /><br />On the other hand I doubt very many people who are concerned with vitamins and healthy beverages will be attracted to the Fruit Punch flavor. I can still occasionally stomach ultra-sugary Kool-Aid or Hi-C and I think that the MiO Fruit Punch is actually on of the better flavors the brand offers. Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch, however, has all the overly sweet taste of these other products with the addition of a nasty tang, probably due to the Vitamin C. At least that is what I'm guessing the bad after taste comes from because I've had the same experience with other Vitamin C beverage enhancers. Either way, the flavor is pretty gross.<br /><br />The other thing about Vitamin Squeeze you need to take into account is the fact that it is far less versatile than MiO or even just bottled drinks. You have to carry around the large, 12-ounce container PLUS whatever you are flavoring with it.

It also states that it is ""nutritious and delicious.""<br /><br />While I'll agree on the delicious part and the amount of vitamins it provides, I have my doubts about the ""energy"" factor of this water enhancer.<br /><br />The taste really is good.  I was given the fruit punch flavor and enjoyed it very much.  Supposedly one squeeze is all you need (per directions), but there's no specific guideline as to how much a ""squeeze"" really is.  Sure, there are hash marks on the bottle to help you in your squeezing, but the bottle has no place at which to see inside of it to see how much of the enhancer you've squeezed out.  I just decided to go with the flavor of the enhancer.  If the water tasted too watery, I simply squeezed in more of the enhancer.<br /><br />I drank this while working out, adding it to my water while I exercised.

I have now fallen in love with Crystal Light's Wild Strawberry-Energy.  I opted to get this supplement/energy drink through Vine.  The price is reasonable.  One container holds a pretty large amount of servings.  Let me tell you WHY I only gave this product 3 stars:<br /><br />***The bottle is 'confusing':  Before anybody makes comments about my being illiterate or something equivalent to it, let me explain.  The manufacturer has you measure the serving size by placing lines  on the wrapper.  However there is NO WAY to see inside the container to determine if you've measured the correct amount.  This makes a user have to guess and add more, if needed, based on taste.  What they SHOULD have done is place a see-through section next to the lines so you can see where you need to stop.<br /><br />***The flavor leaves a lot to be desired.  I drank one cup of it and I think that will have been the only cup.  Granted, it has no calories or anything but flavoring.  I am able to drink Crystal Light with artificial sweetener and regular sodas with sugar or corn syrup.  Vitamin Squeeze, however, just didn't taste good.  Maybe it was because it has no sweetener in it and I tend to dislike drinks that fall in that category.  You, on the other hand, may enjoy unsweetened drinks.  If that's the case, you MAY like it.

B006MONQMC,"Tastes great, but doesn't give much of a boost. Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink Fruit Punch is probably one of the better-tasting energy drink mixes that I've tried. Where so many really lack in the taste department (so much so that you have to force yourself to drink a lot of them), the Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch actually had me coming back for more. It's also convenient. Squeeze in your punch mix (roughly one squeeze per 8 ounces of water), top it off with water and stir. If there's not enough flavor for you (or one would presume, energy kick as well), then add a bit more. At the recommended serving ratio, the taste is light and refreshing and not-at-all syrupy.<br /><br />The issue that I have with the Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch is that it really didn't seem to provide much of an actual energy boost. If you're used to standard energy drinks or workout drinks, you're probably not going to get much of an energy kick here. It's on par with a caffeinated soda, which while certainly caffeinated, the actual content is a good bit less than someone looking for an ""energy drink"" would normally expect, so keep that in mind. It does have the obligatory smattering of vitamins and minerals as well.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink Fruit Punch certainly tastes good, but unless you don't normally partake in caffeine, there's not going to be the energy drink-like boost that you're used to (might be a good product for those who don't normally drink a lot of caffeinated beverages, as the content is pretty low; 40 mg per 8 ounce serving). It tastes good and is calorie-free (sucralose), so with the vitamins, it's certainly a healthier alternative than a lot of the other products out there.",0,0

The flavoring was fine for me, tasted like fruit punch but not overwhelming - although I did add more than you probably should!  I don't know that I necessarily felt an energy bust but it definitely was better than plain water. It does have to be refrigerated which is nice because it adds for a colder drink but it is also not portable though.  I think I can stretch this bottle for a month and will definitely be looking for it again!",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Taste pretty good, but a little low on the energy level This taste pretty good. There are no sweeteners or calories so it's doesn't have the strong sugary taste. But the fruit punch is really good, it doesn't leave you bloated like soda. It's priced at $23 for 4 packs. That seems like a lot, but you get a lot more drinks per bottle. You also have to use each bottle within 30 days of opening it. I love the taste even though it's a little watery with just one squeeze. My biggest complaint is that it cost $23, I can't see myself paying that much. I also didn't feel a strong energy push from it.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes great but I didn't feel the energy and it ruined my shirt I like the idea of sprucing up some water and getting a little kick of energy at the same time. This product is a great concept. Though I didn't feel the energy kick, I did like the taste.<br /><br /> Be careful when you are adding this to your drink. The nozzle was not properly punctured on my bottle and an arrant stream of red liquid quickly found it's way to staining my shirt. The faulty Nozzle continues to be an issue, but we have learned to work around it.<br /><br />Overall the product tastes good but I wouldn't call it an energy drink. I know it's got energy stuff in it, but I didn't feel the kick like with most real energy beverages.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Mix with something Flavorful This is a convenient little energy drink additive (key word, it's a concentrate and it's meant to be added to something else). Simply hold it over your drink, give it a squeeze, and it will shoot a dose into your drink. As far as what to put it in? I wouldn't recommend water. Alone, this tastes like medicine. If you add it to crystal light or something, it's good. You'll taste it, you'll know it's there, but it isn't bad and it will turn your regular beverage into an energy drink.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Convenient, healthier alternative Used to drinking a sugared-caffeinated soda for your afternoon kick?  This isn't going to provide the same results.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze is going to have greater appeal to those who drink plain or flavored water or are looking for a healthy alternative to what they've been drinking.  A squirt (24 per bottle) into 8 oz of water gives you 120% of Vitamin C, 40% of B3, B5, B6 and B12, 40 mg of natural caffeine and 10 mg of Taurine without any calories, carbs, sugar or sodium.<br /><br />The flavor is mild fruit punch, although you can make it stronger by adding more squeeze (meaning you won't get 24 servings out of the bottle).  If you normally drink plain water the normal squeeze is enough to liven it up.  And 24 servings per bottle with 4 bottles per pack at $23.92 per pack, the cost is  .25 per serving, a much cheaper and convenient alternative to bottled beverages.<br /><br />Alas, I'm a Coke drinker (1 per day), so while I enjoy the flavor and knowledge that I'm drinking something much better for my body, even though it has more mg of caffeine than my Coke, the lack of the caffeine/sugar combo means I don't notice the same boost of energy from this.  My soda-free co-workers do see a difference.<br /><br />5 stars for the health benefits, the flavor, price per serving and convenience.  But until I can break the sugar habit, this isn't coming across as an energy drink for me.  Still drinking it for the vitamins, though.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"OK product I order this stuff to see if I could induce my wife to hydrate herself better.  She hates drinking water but doesn't like many juices either.  This is a decent alternative if flavored water is your thing.  Below I've outlined the highlights of both good and bad:<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />*  It's convenient.  It fits easily in the fridge and can even be stored in the pantry (I think?).  Much better than a gigantic jug of juice.<br />*  It's kind of nice to be able to control the intensity of the flavor.  If it's not strong enough, just squeeze a little more.<br />*  I suppose it's reasonably healthy.  I couldn't find anything objectionable.<br />*  The taste is good - if you like the Kool-Aid taste.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />*  I have no idea how to read the chart on the back.  It's suppose to indicate how many squeezes to flavor X amount of water.  What's one squeeze?  You could eject half the contents of the bottle out with one squeeze if you wanted to.  The best method is the taste test, but this is a little subjective.<br />*  It stains BAD and it stains FAST.  The first time I used it, a dab of juice concentrate plopped out of my glass of water onto the butcher-block counters.  I left it for a few minutes while I finished the drink and took it to my wife for the first trial.  By the time I wiped it up, it had already stained - and it's still there today.  Be careful with this stuff.<br />*  The taste is good - but ONLY if you like the Kool-Aid taste.<br /><br />Not much else to say.  The product basically works as advertised.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"sweet, fruity, tasty, a yummy mix-in The bottle seemed to indicate ""one squeeze"" per 8 oz. So, I filled a water bottle to the 8 oz mark, and did one ""squeeze."" - Well, my squeeze, was one full press-in until there no longer comes out the mix-in. Well, that added about 4 oz of flavour. So...I had to add about 12 oz of water. 20 oz to the 4 oz of ""one squeeze""  is fine, but for me, that is was still a bit too sweet. So, 20 oz to 4 oz. is just right. Sweet and fruity tasting, but not too overwhelming or sweet to make it undrinkable or unpleasant to drink.<br />I enjoy the flavour. It has that nice sweet-fruity taste, but doesn't taste too much like that fake fruit or something sweet but loses the fruity taste.<br />I REALLY enjoy the taste (leaves no aftertaste and is not overpowering with any lingering or tasting bad after eating something such as crackers - I tried some flavoured Triscuts -and the flavour of the fruit - I LOVE fruit. It's not a distinct 'strawberry' or 'raspberry,' but a mixed fruit, almost like a fruit punch, but not quite. I think both children, teens, and adults would find this a very palatable and enjoyable vitamin mix-in for all to enjoy.<br /><br />The bottle nutrition facts labels one serving as 1/2 oz. - so my guess is that is what ""one squeeze"" means.<br /><br />*The 'lift' tab to open it doesn't really help - one has to just pull up and off the seal.<br />*Be CAREFUL when pulling off the seal; the juice-vitatmin mix slopped out and sloshed onto me. The pink-red mixture MIGHT stain, but if you dab it off, spray it with something like Spray & Wash (or maybe rubbing Fel's Naptha - or use both) to get it off.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Finally... Something for BOTH Energy & Sport Drink fans This liquid is designed for flavoring water and adding vitamins.  Many of these drinks are out there right now, but this is one of the few that includes caffeine and taurine in addition to the vitamins.<br /><br />To me, this tastes like Sports drinks when added to water.  But with the extras in there like caffeine, you can add this to carbonated water / club soda to make an energy drink instead.  The main difference between the two drink types is only the fizz, so easily enough you can make the choice for yourself on how you prefer Vitamin Squeeze.<br /><br />I always believed that the sport and energy drink families should have been intermingling many years ago.  In fact, I was adding them together for workouts up until I found this product.  Cool idea... this should've been done a long time ago.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Not horrible and not delicious...I would not buy on my own! I have been trying to find some liquids healthier than sodas/drinks to drink.  Thus, when I saw this Squeeze drink, I thought I would give it a try.  The directions say ONE squeeze per 8 ounce bottle.  I did the one squeeze and the drink tastes like a strawberry version of gatorade.  It is not bad tasting and not good tasting; it tastes ""ahright.""<br /><br />The labelling indicates that it is an energy drink.  I have been drinking it and I don't feel any added energy.<br /><br />One commenter said she had to poke a hole through the top.  If you unscrew the top, there is a label that needs to be pulled off.  When you pull off the label, the opening will be clear as a bell and the liquid will flow through.<br /><br />In summation:<br /><br />This drink tastes so-so.  It is hard to open with all the wrapping.  It doesn't give you any energy.",0,-1
B006MONQMC,"Diversionary squeeze play I've been searching for a new product to satiate my junk drink fix I could leave in plain sight ever since the homefront Stasi confiscated my stock of sugar laden 'fruit' drinks and carbonated beverages, going so far as to initiate daily inspections of MY basement sanctuary refrigerator.  She only descends to the dungeon once a week to do laundry asserting I have rendered the place otherwise uninhabitable yet now she has no qualms about daily covert excursions to embargo my stash.<br /><br />Despite my high hopes, Vitamin Squeeze can only serve as a red herring for my personal nutrition inspector Javert because although it is minimally acceptable for quick hydration, it will not compel me to skip the beverage aisle to replenish my cache of Hawaiian punch, Pepsi and orange crush (Okay,  some peppery V8, orange and apple juice as well but they detract from my riff). The product seems convenient and reasonably easy to use although determining consistent squeeze pressure to accommodate my taste preferences in 8 oz. of water is a challenge.<br /><br />My first attempt resulted in four times the suggested amount so I guess me and the product manufacturer have widely disparate perceptions of general squeeze pressure. That rate would result in merely six glasses per container. Only afterwards did I notice the striations on the side of the bottle which approximate the recommended squeeze amount of ½ oz. per 8 oz. glass, so long as the bottle's solution level is visually discernible with offset illumination.<br /><br />But, I guess I am consistent since I didn't notice the perforations around the cap wrapping until I had stabbed it with a steak knife either. Once the tabbed safety seal is removed, also be sure to replace the cardboard washer correctly or it is quite likely you will end up with a syrupy fruit punch stain wherever the inverted bottle is to be stored.<br /><br />Even so, I wasn't enthusiastic about the sweetness or aftertaste with the suggested application - or my prodigious proportion - as in each instance a metallic aftertaste was evident, in the case of the reduced amount simply in what looked like watered down Hawaiian punch. That said, in either case it is a vast improvement over the saltiness of Gatorade.<br /><br />On the positive side at that rate using it up within 30 days shouldn't be a problem, in fact using it up in a couple of exercise sessions is nearly guaranteed. Since the container appeared so portable and the enhancer is obviously much more soluble than a powdery type addictive, one of my brilliant ideas was to keep a container in my car since I tend consume a lot of appreciably less healthy fluids while driving between business sites but the instructions also suggest refrigeration after opening so how that will work out is yet to be determined.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"A Squeeze is all you need Great new product, I have tried 3 of the 4 flavors... TROPICAL CITRUS; ACAI, GRAPE POMEGRANATE and Energy PEACH GREEN TEA. I work in a high school and I am always getting sick.  I have been drinking Vitamin Squeeze for several months now and HAVE NOT BEEN SICK ONCE...this is the only thing I have done differently!  I don't like the taste of the tap water at the school, so this product is ideal for changing the tap water into a drink that is delicious and motivates me to drink more water. Finally, a truly great drink, which is much better than MIO and half the price of Vitaminwater! All it takes is a ""little"" squeeze for me.  Vitamin Squeeze does not leave an aftertaste like some 0 calorie products.  0 calorie, 0 carbs, 0 sugar!  Love it! My teens think the Tropical Citrus tastes like Tang or a Creamsicle. I am headed back to Safeway to get more!  I highly recommend this product!",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Good source of Vitamin C I found the fruit punch flavor of the Vitamin Squeeze energy drink to be far superior to other vitamin enhanced beverages such as vitaming water.  One squeeze in a 12 oz glass of water givers you 120% of your daily intake of vitamin C and about 40% of your daily minimum requirements of most of the B vitamins.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that one bottle can refresh 24 glasses of water meaning it will last more than a day.  You can also do about three squirts in your canteen when you go hiking for a refreshing break.<br /><br />I did like the punch flavor.  It was not overpowering and brought some life to my tapwater.  My kids like it too so that is a plus.<br /><br />Overall it is a no cal super influx of vitamins to your diet, better than soda, and very good for you.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Pour, squeeze, drink I like this product very much. It has a resemblance to Kool-Aid in terms of the fruit punch taste, just not as sweet. It also isn't overpowered by a taste of vitamins like some other vitamin infused drinks such as Vitamin Water can be (I actually find Vitamin Water to be okay, it's just certain flavors have a heavy bottled vitamin taste. I would totally have this stocked in the house or at work and I would wholeheartedly recommend this. Try it, you'll like it!",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Like it at Home NOT On-The-Go Loved the Fruit Punch flavor, all the vitamins, nutrients and ENERGY benefits A LOT. Liked the convenient, pre-measured one-squeeze delivery per 8 ounces of water. There are 24 squeezes/servings per bottle. Having these benefits being just a ""squeeze away"" are cool for my at-home life. At current price, $24 for 4 bottles it's $.25 per serving. It has ZERO calories due to the artificial sweetener sucralose - generic Splenda.<br /><br />I prefer the flexibility of pre-measured powder packet to add to my re-fillable water bottle while on-the-go. ME lugging COLORFUL liquids around IS a disaster waiting to happen. It didn't give more umph than my daily multi-vitamin with a cup of coffee.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Better Off Mio I got this product because I was getting low on the Mio liquid I had and this seemed similar.  It is similar, though with a couple of differences.<br /><br />First, this is more like the Mio Energy line than the regular kind.  Ironically about the time I got this product in the mail I decided I should cut back on caffeine; this product has 40mg of ""natural"" caffeine, D'OH!<br /><br />Second, while Mio liquid does not have to be refrigerated, this product should be refrigerated according to the label.  If you're just using it at home then it's not a big deal to keep it in the fridge.  But if you were thinking of taking it with you maybe to work or while exercising or on vacation or something, then forget about it.<br /><br />As for the taste, I thought it was OK.  I like the Mio fruit punch I have better.  So overall I'd just stick with the Mio liquid.<br /><br />That is all.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Tastes good This drink tastes as good or better than similar drinks that we've had that are made of powder.  The directions don't tell you how much to squeeze into your water, so I would imagine it depends on how big of a glass or bottle you have and how strong you want it to taste.  You can always add more.  The only concern I have about it is there is caffeine in it and I really don't want to have any extra caffeine after my coffee in the morning.  You might want to beware of that if you are buying this for children.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"A Pretty Good Value... If you are looking for a water flavoring product, there's been a lot of powders out there to choose from.  Somewhat recently, there's been a new trend of liquid additives that you can put into your water to make it less boring.  The obvious advantage of a liquid additive is that you don't have the mess and hassle of powdering spilling everywhere.  It's quick, convenient, and easy.<br /><br />Now, what sets this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink apart from competitors such as the MIO things?  Well, mostly price.  I noticed that this is a much larger item, and per ounce, is a much better value.  As for taste, I've had tastier water flavorings.  In fact, if you can believe this, the tastiest thing I've tried is an off-brand MIO knock-off (I believe the brand was Fit & Active).  The taste of this Vitamin Squeeze flavoring is sort of bland (but also calorie free, so that's nice), and then if you increase the amount used, just gets too strong.  There's just never a point where I felt like it was just right, even though I experimented with how many squeezes to use.  That being said, the taste is tolerable and not too bad.<br /><br />All in all, I wouldn't buy this drink flavoring just for it's taste alone (although you may want it for the vitamins in it).  I would, however, recommend it just for being the best value that I've seen so far for a product of its type.  If you need a liquid water flavoring at the best price possible (as of this review writing), this is the product to go with for sure.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Great source of Vitamin C For me, I like these squeezable flavors. I like Mio too, but this one is much bigger and seems to last much longer for the same cost.  Make sure to refrigerate as instructed.  It also says it should be used within 30 days of opening, that shouldn't be too hard and probably isn't that big of a deal, but good to note.  I usually use half the suggested ""squirts"" because I like a more subtle flavor, the same with this fruit punch version.  Personally, I think this is a great idea and great alternative to water. No carbs, no sugar, lots of vitamins and...chemicals - what could be better????",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes Good!... I really liked this product, though it did take a couple uses to get it just right. I've found that a little definitely goes a long way. For an 8 oz glass of water, you just want to give the bottle a quick squeeze...any more than that and it's too sweet/strong.<br /><br />Also, you're gonna want to drink this rather quickly. I'm not someone who guzzles their drinks quickly (I can make a single bottle of water last an entire day), and the first time I tried this I took a couple sips, set it on the table and picked it up again after about a half hour or so...YUCK! It was not good. I don't know what happened in that 30 minutes to make the taste change so much, but it's certainly better when it's cold. Overall though, it's pretty good! It has a strong fruit punch flavor, and is much more enjoyable than a glass of plain 'ol water.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Pleasantly Surprised! As I'm writing this review, I'm drinking a bottle of water that I've used this product with. The fruit punch flavor is nice, and having this product sure makes it convenient to add those ""vitamins"" to your drink. Overall, I'm very happy with the product, but only have two complaints. If indicates 1 squeeze for every 8 ounces. What exactly is 1 squeeze? Is it a long squeeze? A short squeeze? I don't feel I've completely found the happy medium yet. The first time I tried the product,  I found I had to squeeze it about 3-4 times to get enough saturation in the drink to actually taste the fruit punch and act more like I'd expect it to be. Subsequent uses I've done longer squeezes, and that seems to do the trick. Sometimes I do find I've squeezed too much though, and have more flavor than I'd prefer. The other complaint I have isn't necessary due to the product itself, but due to water bottles. They're filled to the brim when you get them, so in order to use this product you have to drink some. Not a big deal, and not really a fault of the product itself, but is definitely an inconvenience. Overall, however, this is a great way to add some flavor and vitamins to your drink without having to pickup vitamin water or a sport drink. Just buy the regular bottled water, and when you feel you need some flavor, just squeeze a decent amount in, and you'll be set.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Pretty Good, Just Watch for the Contents First, let me state the taste isn't bad at all, almost tastes like it has sugar but it doesn't.  Instead it contains Sucralose.<br /><br />Now for the energy part.  Part of its jolt comes from 40mg of along with a good dose of Taurine.  That's not a problem.<br /><br />What is a problem is the portion recommended which is 1/2 ounce.  Allegedly you get 24 servings in this bottle but I guess that depends upon what you consider a glass of water.  I found that most bottled waters took at least a double dose to get decent flavor and that means doubling the dose of caffeine and Taurine.<br /><br />As I soon discovered, that means jitters, especially if you've had anything else containing caffeine (such as my morning cup of Joe).<br /><br />Overall, this isn't bad and if you use tap water or purify your own it's definitely cheaper than buying energy water in the store.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Finally more bang for your buck! My favorite part of this product is the size. Finally there is a water enhancer that is bigger than the palm of my hand. This is a large enough bottle that I don't have to worry about running out after just a few squirts and I won't lose it in my gym bag. The taste is great too! I think all the different brands taste really good, however, I have found that their recipe of one squirt for a 8 oz glass is not always accurate. Well with this Vitamin Squeeze Energy the one squirt tastes great! It's a great product and I'll definitely buy it again.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"It's Okay This product claims to add two things to water: flavor and an energy boost.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty good, sweet but not too sweet, like a punch made from all-natural juices.  Getting it just right is difficult, though, because of the inexact science of mixing it with the right amount of water.  The bottle says ""one squeeze per eight ounces,"" but a squeeze can be very short or very long, so it's hard to know how much to use.  The bottle says it contains 24 squeezes, but unless you want to measure 1/24th of the bottle with a measuring spoon or mix the whole bottle in with a gallon and a half of water right away and draw from that supply, that's no help.  I tended to err on the side of more rather than less; underestimating the squeeze produced a pretty watery flavor.<br /><br />As for energy, it didn't do much for me.  When it first came in the mail I immediately poured a glass of water and mixed it in while sitting around.  At that point I thought I felt a little energy boost; but when I would drink it during a workout, I found it was no more revitalizing than plain water.<br /><br />So call it two and a half stars: four stars for the flavor, one for the (lack of) energy boost.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Easy way to flavor your water, or your kids' water! Fruit punch may not be my favorite flavor, but I've been enjoying a daily glass of Vitamin Squeeze as a break from water.  My favorite thing about Vitamin Squeeze is its customizable flavor.  My 15 year old daughter prefers two squeezes in 8 oz, which is twice the recommendation.  I prefer one long squeeze in 16 oz. of water. I don't like a heavy flavor.<br /><br />The bottle was very easy to squeeze, but that was also a negative.  It was hard to control exactly how much you put in.  Some water glasses were more strongly flavored than others.  I appreciate that it immediately disperses in the water, without having to be shaken or stirred.<br /><br />It was very easy to put a little squirt into my toddler's water cup, and know she's enjoying a little flavor along with vitamins.  My children would drink it all day long, if I let them.  I would prefer serving them this rather than a sugary flavored beverage ... but the cost is too high.  My children could easily finish two of the $6 bottles in a week.<br /><br />So, while we enjoy the Vitamin Squeeze, it's not a practical option for our entire family. At least not on a daily basis.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink"" For those of us who drink several bottles of water each day, Vitamin Squeeze adds zest to our lives. One squirt of Vitamin Squeeze will transform your ordinary bottle of water into a yummy vitamin packed tasty drink. The 12 fluid once bottle contains twenty-four (24) squirts, so each bottle goes a long way. One squirt will provide 120% of the USDA daily requirement for Vitamin C and 40% for vitamins B3, B5, B6 & B12. With no calories, sugar or carbohydrates, you get the nutrition and delicious taste without the weight gain.<br /><br />It does contain Red 40 to give it the red color. In my opinion, removing the Red 40 and leaving the drink clear would be an improvement. Also, being that Vitamin Squeeze is a concentrate 24:1, and contains 40 mg of natural caffeine, I would keep it out of reach of small children.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Good flavor, good energy, no calories I've tried a few different products to give some flavor to water without adding a lot of sugar or calories, and this one compares well with the other options on the market.  It has no calories, but lots of vitamins and some caffeine for energy (I should warn people with caffeine sensitivities that you have to look closely on the label to see that there are 40 mg of caffeine per serving).  It dissolves very well in water, even without stirring.  Taste-wise, I was unimpressed at the recommended one-squeeze serving - it wasn't a strong enough flavor for me to pick up anything but a little citrus bitterness, but by doubling the amount of energy fluid, the fruit punch taste was refreshing and pleasant, with a little more complexity than I expected from the name.

The bottle is large, not convenient to carry with you in a workout bag for the gym or backpack on a hike. And, sucralose is an artificial sweetener that I would rather avoid.

(Just be sure you blend the mix with water, which I neglected to do the first time I drank it -- way too strong!)<br /><br />Another plus is that there are some B and C vitamins, electrolytes and ""natural caffeine"" in the mix, which I'm guessing my Kool-Aid didn't contain back in the day.

I was pleased to fine that this product adds a nice flavor to water without adding any chemical-like after taste.<br /><br />Pros: good flavor, no aftertaste, easy to get the proportions right (works if you just add a little; hard to get ""too much""), helps me to drink more water<br />Cons: bright red color unnecessary, not sure about the need for added vitamins, needs to be refrigerated, not terrifically concentrated (large bottle won't last long)",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Not bad at all for zero calories I'm a bit conflicted about how to rate this.  On the one hand, it tastes surprisingly good for a diet flavoring. And the addition of plenty of B and C vitamins is nice. However, I don't really care for this much, and the reason is the chemical aftertaste of the Sucralose that they use. For some reason I mistakenly assumed this product would just be unsweetened flavoring. Since I was clearly mistaken about what I was getting, I don't feel it would be fair to write a negative review. So, I'm giving this four stars because for a diet drink, this is pretty darn good. The flavor is well balanced and like a Red Bull if Red Bull has any sense of sublety,, and the aftertaste is pretty much par for the course for artificially sweetened stuff. So if you're used to diet drinks, I think you'll probably like this. The convenience and cost efficiency of having a super concentrated syrup that you just squirt into tap water is great, and makes me really wish they made this without any sweetener at all.<br /><br />Just be aware if you're considering this that part of the ""energy"" boost comes from caffeine.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tasty energy drink concentrate w/ Zero calories One bottle of this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink makes 24, one cup, servings of fairly tasty diet juice drink.  The flavor is similar to something like Vitamin Water Zero, but slightly less ""diet"" or fake sweetener flavor.  This fruit punch concentrate basically consists of natural flavors, sucralose (splenda) caffeine, and vitamins + taurine.  The flavor is better than I expected.  I will drink this daily, no doubt.<br /><br />Each serving gets you 120% daily vitamin C, and 40% daily of B vitamins.  There is 40mg of caffeine (slightly more than a coca cola, slightly less than a mountain dew, or 1/2 the caffeine in a Red Bull).<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- Flavor.  Pretty good for a zero calorie drink.  Sweet but not too fake tasting.<br />- Compact.  Saves fridge space.<br />- Nutrition.  Zero sugar.  Vitamins and a splash of caffeine.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Dosing.  One squeeze is supposed to yield 15ml (1/2 fl oz).  I placed my glass on a kitchen scale and found it takes about a medium-long squeeze to yield 15ml.  A short squeeze is 10 ml.  The longest squeeze was more like 22ml.  I say go by flavor.  In 8 oz of water it should be fairly flavorful, but not too strong or watery.<br /><br />Overall I like this product and will use it up.  4+ stars.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes Good, Maybe it Gave Energy This Vitamin Squeeze had 40mg of caffeine, and since I don't drink caffeinated beverages, I thought it would give me a buzz. It did not, but it mixes instantly, tastes terrific, and made my boring water a vitamin dream. I held back one star because of the packaging. The plastic that rips off the flip-top was not perforated well and I ended up having to pull a good bit of the label off. Not good. Then, underneath the flip-top, you remove the ""seal,"" but the tab to pull it free with snapped off and I was forced to dig the seal off another way (i.e. teeth, lol). I like this product for what it says it does.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Like it for a change of taste. I don't drink as much water as I should, so I was happy to get a bottle to review. I like it for what it is. It has 0 calories and give the water a sweet, artificial fruity taste that look like a popular red punch drink. So, I'm not huge into the flavor, but it is different than other obvious options like adding fruit or fruit juice to water. It has vitamin C, B6, B5, Zink, B3, B12, magnesium and chromium and 40 mg of caffeine. The bottle is a size that I can keep in the small fridge at work. It is suggested to finish it within 30 days. The squeeze once feature doesn't seem to work on my bottle. I was putting it in a glass of water (16 oz?) and it hadn't stopped coming out when I had more than enough. From now on I will just measure or use less. I'm not a huge fan of sucralose, but I'm only planning on 1 or less servings a day, so won't worry about this. In conclusion, I like it for what it is and will consider purchasing it again for a change of taste with a pick-me up.",1,0

B006MONQMC,Not for me! I didn't like the taste of this stuff when squirted int either plain or soda water.  I suspect the energy comes from the caffeine used in the juice.,0,-1
B006MONQMC,Yuck!!!! The taste is so gross that I can't even finish it. I wouldn't waste my money on this. I would rather have an energy drink and take a multi-vitamin everyday if I needed caffeine.,-1,-1

Well, this turned out to be like the rest. Flavors the water well, nice while in the mouth, after that the after taste sets in. I don't know about the vitamins. there is no noticeable sign that i am getting any additional vitamins. And except for the claim of adding vitamins,for me, this is the same as any other flavoring for water.",0,-1
B006MONQMC,"Reminds Me of Hawaiian Punch I cant say how much energy this drink supplement will give you, but I do enjoy the taste. It tastes like Hawaiian Punch did to me as a kid, but without the sugar. You just squeeze some into some water and you have a healthy drink without the carbonation or sugar of soft drinks. I like it. It's a nice break from lemonade, iced tea and other such drinks. And it makes water taste good!",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Good for you, good tasting! The flavor of this product is good - a bit too sweet, but that's par for the course with these sort of things. It is satisfying to know that my daily afternoon drink is providing all the vitamins i need for the day!<br /><br />It isn't as concentrated as some of the other flavored drink mixes on the market, which means the bottle is really big. It may sound like an unimportant thing, but it's harder to toss it in your purse when the bottle is so large. But that's my only real complaint. Otherwise this product is pretty good.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Flavors my drink, no boost to be found It did make my water taste like fruit punch. Of course, I felt like I wasn't gauging the ""one squeeze"" correctly. Or maybe I was? It felt like I was using a lot to the ratio of water to get a taste that wasn't so diluted. Regardless, it didn't taste bad once I reached a nice saturation point.<br /><br />As far as energy? I don't really think so. It wasn't any different from when I use Mio. No more or less feeling of a 'boost'.<br /><br />I'll stick to my Mio. Thanks.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Meh ... This Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, was short on Energy.  I didn't feel more energized or refreshed when using this product.  Also the directions are to add 1 `squeeze' of this vitamin packed liquid to 8 oz of water or other beverage.  However I felt these directions were a bit vague considering it's a vitamin supplement, my squeeze might be lighter then say my husbands, and my kids would just squeeze till it stopped.  It should really have another measure for dispensing or wording like ""1 Squeeze or about 2oz"" It would only take 1 or 2 times of squeezing 2oz into a measuring cup to figure out the right amount of pressure and flow for accurate dosing/taste.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavoring was a bit fruity, but when I added a lot it got a bit mineral tasting I thought.  Over all I wasn't that impressed with this item.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Compared to Crystal Light I am used to the powdered packets that Crystal light offers, and I think I could go either way. The nice thing about this is that you can add as much as you like until the taste is as strong as you want it to be.

B006MONQMC,"It's Okay for a quick shot of caffeine that tastes like Kool-Aid This Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is a simple way to get a few extra vitamins and some caffeine added to your drinking water.  It contains some vitamin C, B vitamins and a couple others.  Nothing real special about that.  It has some caffeine, about like a cup of coffee would have.<br /><br />It sort of reminded me of drinking Kool-Aid.  (I hadn't had any for a long, long time.)  It's not bad, but you have to like Kool-Aid and similar sweet drinks.  With the easy squeeze bottle, you can regulate how much you add to your water pretty easily and come up with the sweetness/flavor you like.  (Again, if you like sweet Kool-Aid type drinks.)  It does leave a bit of an aftertaste after drinking.  Not bad, but it was there.<br /><br />It's faster and easier than powder, and I like that the squeeze bottle doesn't leak or drip.  However, it is recommended to be kept in the refrigerator.  Makes it harder to take on the go to add to water when you are out and about and need that boost of caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's okay.  I actually prefer to just hydrate with plain water and get my caffeine from coffee.  But for a once in a while squirt of vitamins and a caffeine boost, this isn't bad.  And being reminded of yesteryear drinking Kool-Aid isn't bad either.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"tastes better than MIO, like the price but the caffeine made me jumpy I liked the taste of this a little better than the MIO ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4ADKU"">MIO Fruit Punch, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> )fruit punch and found that the instructions were much more clear on how much makes a good mix for the right amount of flavor.  I liked that there was some nutritional content to the drink as well.  The design of the bottle is better and it's easy to figure out just how hard to squeeze to get the correct amount into your bottle or into your tea pitcher.  It's fruity enough and since I don't mine Splenda, the Sucralose in this product didn't bother me either.  It was not too sweet.  The price for the number of servings works out to be more reasonable than MIO because I find I have to use almost 4 times the recommended amount of Mio to acheive the same flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's a tiny one, was the first time I used it, I squeezed an awful lot into already caffeinated Tea and gave myself quite a ZAP!  I got a minor headache a few hours later.  Now I know to use this alone with water or with herbal tea.  It works totally fine that way for me.  If you too are careful about your servings of Cafeeine per day, be sure and count this into your daily intake to avoid withdrawal issues, ok?<br /><br />Overall, good price, good taste and nice design.  it could be a little better but I'd buy it on sale.  UPDATE 4/27/12:  I have gotten used to the caffeine in the product and bought another bottle on sale after getting used to adding this to my homebrewed iced tea.  Now I used it more to kick up the flavor in Herbal Iced teas due to the caffeine quotient.  I still prefer this packaging to MIO on every level.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"'it's okay' about sums it up A bit ambivalent about this drink, as it has its pros and cons.  The fruit punch has a nice flavor to it, not too sweet but about what you'd expect for a flavor enhancer.  It says that one squeeze will do for 8 ounces, but mileage can vary per that squeeze (depending on how much force you use).  Maybe I'm not squeezing that much.  You have to be careful removing the inner seal, something that can be a bit nerve-wracking considering the red coloring of the contents.  I'm also not sure how much of a boost the caffeine will give.  If you want to carry this around to flavor your water all day, you might want to rethink that considering the size (similar to that of a ketchup bottle).<br /><br />That said, it does have a nice list of vitamins and no carbs or calories (which is a lot better than most 'vitamin' waters out there that you buy by the bottle at quite the cost - as long as you don't mind fake sugar) and should last you a while.  It's great to keep at the office or home.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Convenient and not too sweet This is much more convenient than buying and storing the bottled vitamin drinks, and more eco-friendly. And unlike the little packets of powder, you don't even need a spoon to stir it into your glass of water. I got the fruit punch which tastes much like kool-aid, but would like to try another, more adult flavor. Wonder if they'll bring out a tea flavored variety?<br /><br />It apparently doesn't need refrigeration after opening, but tastes better quite cold. You could even keep a bottle on your desk.",1,1

B006MONQMC,"Eazy Squeezy We have all seen the commercials lately for little squeezy bottles of flavoring, energy, vitamins you can squirt right into any bottle or glass of water. Apparently its all the rage to do this, I thought since I am a happening gal I better get to squeezing.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze is a largish bottle, sort of like a mini ketchup squeezer except this isnt for Fries or a burger. Its for your water. Because drinking plain old water just wont hack it anymore. This product, with one squeeze per 8 oz of water will give you 120% of your vitamin C for the day, 40% of your Vitamin B3 B5 B6 and B12, 40 mg of caffeine, 10 mg of Taurine, and lotsa Electrolytes.<br /><br />So its an energy drink with perks. How does it taste? Well this is the Fruit Punch flava and it taste pretty fruity punchy, very very sweet, a bit overwhelmingly so. But I liked it just fine. Its good to have if you havent had your coffee, and flintstones, and need a boost for the day. I dont think anyone should be chugging this on top of already having caffeine or your fruits for the day.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Better than Mio I've tried Mio in the past, and this stuff is much better.  Lots of flavor without knocking you over with sugar.

Also, if your family is accident prone like mine, it comes out of clothing without any problems :)",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Giving Mio a Run for the Money I have to say that I liked this product a lot. I tried the Fruit Punch flavor and liked that there was no after taste. I am a Mio drinker and feel this drink could give a Mio a run for its money if it came in a smaller more compact bottle. With Mio, I can throw it in my purse, but it has this odd after taste. On the flip side, a bottle of MIO makes 12 8oz glasses or bottles, where as Vitamin Squeeze makes 24. I will definitely be purchasing this product on a regular basis.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Adds a bit of pep Liquid flavorings and vitamin enhancers have been all the rage for a while.  I was drinking a lot of vitamin waters last year.<br /><br />I have had the opportunity to try two favors of the Mio type of water additive.  It's pretty good and has the big plus that the small bottle fits nicely in a glove box, a backpack, etc.<br /><br />The thing that really surprised me was how big the bottle of vitamin squeeze was.  It's almost as big as a bottle of water itself, which doesn't seem very convenient.<br /><br />The flavor was decent, if you like a look aid style fruit punch.  Of course it says one squeeze, and I gave it a manly squeeze.  It came out a bit too sweet.  You'll have to experiment a bit and find out what works for you.  Of course if ts too sweet, add some more water.  I don't think everyone would like the uncertainty of how much to put in, but, there are always those powders for that.<br /><br />The bottle says to use it within 30 days if opening and it has 24 servings, so, if it's just for you you'll need a daily jolt.<br /><br />The can also recommends refrigeration.<br /><br />Overall it's fine, but I think a half-size bottle would be ok too.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Personally, I enjoy it. With so many different additives to water these days, what distinguishes this one?<br /><br />It comes in a larger bottle of 12 ounces and makes 24 8-ounce servings. This fruit punch flavor is light (similar to, but not heavy like Hawaiin Punch), and I found it refreshing. It has a combination of vitamins B 6, 5, 3, and 12, Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium, and Chromium. Most importantly it has approximately the same level of caffeine as soda, so I can get a nice little jolt.<br /><br />I use a lot of powdered additives to my water, and enjoy the fact that this liquid fully dissolved, unlike the powders. I am keeping this next to my refrigerator and give my bottles their treatment as I take them out of the fridge, before I jump in the car. However, I have had some warm, and it was OK then as well. I don't add a lot to my water, I couldn't figure out how much a squeeze was, and so I started light, and it works nicely for me.<br /><br />The one thing I would like to mention is that the servings are 8 oz size, and most water bottles are 12-16 ounce. If you are figuring price per serving, do keep this in mind. Also, it is recommended that you use this within 30 days of opening it.<br /><br />I have small hands, and often have trouble with pull off tops under seals, so I have the habit of keeping a sharp knife handy to run around the top and remove it. So I opened my bottle using my normal technique ... the extra hermetically sealed package wasn't a problem for me.<br /><br />Good flavor, reasonable price. I will be finishing my sample bottle and looking for it in the market.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Good Flavor - Convienant The product has a good fruit punch flavor. It is nice that you can regulate the strength of the flavor depending upon how much you squirt into your water. Much larger than the similar Mio product. With the larger size, however, could come lack of portabilty for some. I keep this at work and add shots to my water throughout the day. You do notice a slight energy burst, but nothing too significant. It is certainly nothing you are going to ""crash"" after drinking. Overall, 4 stars.",1,1

That said, I prefer Coca Cola in moderation and really natural drinks like orange juice and iced tea....and cold water.

B006MONQMC,"Disappointed, but others may not be I really wanted to like this product.  I'm a pretty active person who is always interested in trying out these supplements (even though I know drinking plain old water works as well as anything else), and I love the taste of fruit drinks.<br /><br />This product certainly delivers when it comes to providing a fair amount of vitamins, especially C.  That makes it a good choice, I guess, for those who don't eat fruit but it may be somewhat superfluous if you're already a healthy eater.  There is taurine in this product too, but only 10mg which is a fraction of what you'd find in energy drinks.  It's a good way to get some vitamins, but I have not noticed any kind of energy boost from its use.<br /><br />I had two issues with this product, which I'll cover briefly:<br /><br />1) Taste - I have always liked the taste of fruit punch, and was disappointed with the flavor of this product.  It tasted vaguely of artificial fruit flavoring, but even with a generous amount I never found it very fruity.  It turned my water red, but no amount of the product could make the flavor appealing.  This is just my opinion, and perhaps for others the taste is just fine.  Related to the taste was the lingering aftertaste from the use of sucralose.  This hardly makes it unique among non-sugar drinks, but I thought it worth mentioning.<br /><br />2) Amount to use - The side of the container says, annoyingly, that one squeeze per 8 ounces of water is what should be used.  However, we don't all have the same squeeze so better directions would be useful (eg. two teaspoons).  Or even better, how about something that limits the amount coming out per squeeze?  It may not seem like a huge deal, but I found it frustrating.<br /><br />I doubt I'll use this product much, given that there isn't anything to really separate it from all of the similar products already on the market.  Others may find it useful, though, and I certainly wouldn't pan it as a bad drink additive.",0,-1
B006MONQMC,"Don't fall for ""nutritious"" label claims -- artificial sweeteners and preservatives I'm not sure what the target audience for this product is, but it left me confused.. Health-conscious individuals would probably stay away from this item due to the caffeine and artificial ingredients. To say that it is ""nutritious and delicious"" is a bit of a disingenuous marketing stretch. Eating a multi-grain piece of bread is nutritious. This product is fortified with several B vitamins (3, 5, 6, 12) and while vitamins are good for you, drinking a cocktail of caffeine, sucralose (artificial sweetener), sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (preservatives) and Red #40 (an artificial dye, missing from Amazon's product description) probably isn't what most people would consider ""nutritious"". The label says ""all natural favors"", which might lead some consumers to believe this is an all-natural product. It certainly is not. It contains no juices of any kind -- just something mysteriously listed as ""natural flavor"".<br /><br />Vitamin C is very easy to get from fruit and certain vegetables, so you don't need an artificial source of it. Vitamin C is everywhere and deficiency hasn't been a problem for about 100 years. The fruit punch taste is fine. It's on the same level as Kool-Aid, but the sucralose left an unpleasant lingering aftertaste. Going down, it tasted good, but afterwards, it left a strange sensation in the back of my throat. I would certainly not recommend this as a ""healthy"" beverage because of the artificial ingredients and caffeine. Call me a health nut if you wish, but I recommend getting vitamins from whole, unprocessed foods and fruit whenever possible, not from a bottle. The label warns not to serve this to children, or mix it with alcoholic or caffeinated beverages.<br /><br />If you don't mind sucralose and preservatives, this product may still have uses for you. It has zero calories and the squeeze bottle is handy and easy to use, once you get the inner seal off. It has a pull tab, but is glued on so tight that no amount of pulling would get it off. I had to use a knife to puncture the seal and remove it. Product makes 24 servings and the side has markings indicating how much to use, though it is a useless feature because the you can't see through the label to see how much of the product remains. The label is completely opaque.",0,-1

Since this bottle makes 24/8 ounce servings, that's 12-24 bottles of energy drinks not being stored in my fridge or pantry. Very convenient!<br />* Control the flavor intensity.

B006MONQMC,"Tasty water enhancer! First, let me start by saying that I am not a fan of water. I hate plain water -- and anything that will help me to be able to drink more is a good thing in my estimation. I have tried several different ""squirt"" additives (such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4EBMG"">MIO Mango Peach, 1.62 Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>) and found them to be OK but I like this better. At first it seemed that there was a bit of a medicinal taste to the water, but either I got used to it or it faded fast, because now I don't notice it anymore. It's important to shake the bottle well, however, before squeezing it into your drink. I usually fill a tumbler with ice and water (about 16 ounces) and then squeeze the bottle and, voila, my drink is ready. I sometimes stir the additive into the water, but it doesn't really seem to be necessary to do that.<br /><br />Any time you add an artificial flavoring to a product, opinions on whether it is good or bad are going to be entirely a personal reaction. The flavor I received was fruit punch, and I must confess it's not my favorite (I'd prefer cherry), but it goes down easy when I'm really thirsty. I don't consume a lot of fruit either, so I'm glad this product offers 120% of my vitamin C daily requirement per squeeze (serving). It also contains caffeine, taurine, 40% of the RDA for some of the B vitamins and a trace amount of some minerals. NO fat, NO carbohydrates, and NO calories!<br /><br />This is a good sized-bottle so it's not something you can carry everywhere, and it has to be refrigerated after opening. It offers 24 servings (at 15 mL = 1/2 ounce) per bottle so it's about 25¢ a serving. Anyway, I like it and would really like to try another flavor. Anything to increase my water intake!",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Stains, tastes like a vitamin and teens rejected it. The vitamins defiantly leave an aftertaste. Not really strong, but strong enough that both of my teens were not willing to drink it again.

It did not work, the flap pulled off before the seal, so  I had to get a knife to open the seal.<br /><br />The bottle is large, and needs to be refrigerated after opening.<br />I always test these drinks for staining by squirting a little on a cotton rag and throwing it in with the wash.  This stains.  I was able to get it out with a 3 hour soak in stain remover.<br /><br />Overall, disappointing but not horrific.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Enjoyable There are many of these types of water additives on the market today and many of them offer the similar qualities - added vitamins, energy, etc.  Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is no different.  However, what is different is the size - at 12 oz it is much larger than many of the similar products out there.  The flavor is fairly good, however I do still notice that ""strange"" aftertaste which I think just goes with the artificial sweetener, sucralose.  I don't care much for that.  Otherwise the flavor is good - not like Hawaiian Punch to me, as some have mentioned, however that just may be in the tastebuds of the taster.  Does it give me a boost of energy?  None that I noticed, however I think I have some kind of built up tolerance to caffeine and energy drinks because they never seem to do anything for me in the way of wakefulness or energy.  I do have to say that I enjoy the flavor enough that it helps me drink more water.  Not one that is particularly fond of drinking the amount of water that I should each day, this added flavoring does help.  Keep in mind that, unlike other flavor additives, this one does need to be refrigerated and used within 30 days of opening for optimum freshness.  This is not an issue for me and actually makes me feel more assured of its quality by having it refrigerated.  All in all, a very good product and one that I will use and look forward to trying out the other flavors.",1,0

B006MONQMC,"Aesthetically Pleasing Design Ruined By Horrible Taste Throughout the work day, I usually drink about 16 ounces of water just sitting at the desk. The past couple months I've been trying a variety of different energy drinks and supplements. When I had the opportunity to try the VITAMIN SQUEEZE FRUIT PUNCH ENERGY DRINK through Amazon's Vine Program, I decided to give it a try. I'm drinking a lot of water every day anyway, so I figured I might as well try to mix things up a little.<br /><br />The drink itself comes in a container that looks a little like one of those newer upside-down ketchup squeeze bottles. There's supposed to be enough product for 24 8-ounce servings. This water additive concoction contains vitamins B6, B5, B3, B12, C, as well as magnesium and chromium. It's also supposed to contain 40mg of caffeine (about the same as a can of regular soda).<br /><br />I liked the overall design of the bottle. It's aesthetically pleasing and the bottle is quite easy to use once it's opened. It also does seem to provide a very short burst of energy after use. However, I had several issues with the product.<br /><br />The first issue I had with VITAMIN SQUEEZE FRUIT PUNCH ENERGY DRINK is that it's a bit more difficult to open. In addition to removing the wrapping from around the edge, you have to poke open the squeeze hole. I tried just squeezing, but it didn't work. So, I ended up using an ice pick. You can probably use the tip of a knife or a prong of a fork, too.<br /><br />Beyond using a measuring cup, there's no real way to figure out exactly how much of a squeeze is required for an 8-ounce bottle of water (or a 16-once water bottle). So, the user is left to guestimate. It took about a 1/3rd of the bottle over several days before I was able to get close to what I think was the proper amount.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had with this energy drink was the flavor. Personally, I think it tastes horrible. It's supposed to be a fruit punch-flavored additive. However, it tastes more like liquid Sweet Tarts; it has a very strong acidic aftertaste that completely eradicates the initial sweetness that one tastes. After I got down to less than ½ a bottle, I tried drinking the Vitamin Squeeze directly from the bottle. I thought it might help with the flavor. I was completely wrong. The horrible Sweet Tart-taste just became even more pungent.<br /><br />So, though VITAMIN SQUEEZE FRUIT PUNCH ENERGY DRINK does seem to provide a short burst of energy and has lots of vitamins, the positives are almost wiped out by the horrible taste. Personally, I'd take a 5-hour energy drink or a can of NO FEAR over this energy drink.",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"Can't get past the taste Say what you will about Vine reviews skewing too much one way or the other, this was just disgusting. The ""nutrition"" aspects aren't bad--they're not good, either--but the flavor is something that I can't live with. My wife described it as ""watered-down [children's drink with a mascot that breaks through walls]"", but adding more to the water just made the solution taste more ""fake"" and unpalatable.<br /><br />If you dig the flavor, though, you'll get some good B vitamins and caffeine, so I guess this would be good for someone on the go that needed a lift.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Good size, nice taste I had just run out of Mio when this came in the mail. It isn't as sweet as Mio but just as good. It tastes like sugar free Kool-aid. I'm a coffee drinker so haven't noticed much energy from this, but I like it for the vitamins in it and to give a little flavor to the plain water I drink so much of. The bottle is large. Fruit Punch is pretty good and if I see this in stores I will probably buy more.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"We didn't like the taste This taste like kool-aid with a hint of cough syrup. I hate cough syrup and the kids here didn't like the taste either. It also contains caffeine, so you can't give this stuff to kids all day thinking that the vitamins will be good for them (too much caffeine makes kids go hyper active). If you dilute it a lot, it doesn't take like anything except for a kool-aide/cough syrup after taste.<br /><br />The bottle is pretty large though and will last for weeks if you enjoy the taste.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Contains Vitamins, Caffeine and Electrolytes, as well as Red Dye and Sucralose This product is called by the manufacturer: a ""water enhancer"" and boasts to give you vitamins and energy with ""an extra dose of vigor"" and with 0 calories, sugar and carbs, with a fruit punch flavor from ""all natural flavors"". I was curious, so gave it a try.<br /><br />You are supposed to use one squeeze per 8 ounces of water with this package holding 24 servings. Depending on your squeeze time the drink will be weak, just right or strong, so you have to figure out how you like it. It does taste like fruit punch and is sweet thanks to the sucralose.<br /><br />The product is red colored thanks to red dye #40 which some with dye allergies may like to know is present  in this product.<br /><br />As for vitamins, it says it has 120% of the RDA for vitamin C, and has 40 mg or less of Vitamin Bs and taurine. Additives give electrolytes also.<br /><br />The energy is thanks to the added natural caffeine, 40 mg per serving.<br /><br />This is good for covering up the bad taste of tap water or if you just hate the flavor of plain water. The best use of this for my family is to use it when my kids have no choice but to drink terrible tasting water while at Boy Scout camp. Add this to that awful hose water they use at camp, and the Scouts will drink the water provided and they will not only get hydrated but it adds some vitamins and electrolytes. However my family does try to avoid artificial sweeteners in our daily life.<br /><br />This product basically turns your water into an electrolyte and caffeine drink with flavor, not unlike buying the sports drinks pre-made except this is convenient to put into your own water in whatever container you use (water bottle for bike ride or whatever). You will save money by purchasing this instead of premixed energy drinks, too.<br /><br />I think this product has its place although there is still debate over the necessity of drinking electrolyte drinks while doing non-extreme exercising vs. drinking just plain water, and some people will continue to debate whether sucralose should be a part of our daily diets and others seek to avoid food dyes. I will stay out of the debate for my review...the purpose of my review is to tell you what is in this product and how it tastes. I'll let you decide if this is something you want or need to use.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamins and caffeine YES, taste NO <span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:49 Mins<br /><br /></span>There is a powdered packet product that is like a squeeze of fresh lemon or orange. No sweetener, just flavor. Why-O-Why can't a taste like that be in a vitamin water drink? I found this to be overly sweet with artificial 'saccharine' type aftertaste. I'm also afraid that it would stain like ink if spilled. I love the electrolytes and vitamins, adore the caffeine, but can't stand the taste. Taste is subjective, so perhaps others may like it quite a bit, especially if you like a lot of sweetener products in your beverages.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Great idea but taste is off As a mother of 7, I am always looking for healthy alternatives to sodas, Kool-aid, and energy drinks my kids seem to pine for. The fact that this is not a powder (which can be really messy for a child to use) and contains a respectable number of vitamins made me excited to try it.<br /><br />The squeeze bottle is just the right size for even small hands. Also, the liquid mixes instantly in water so a spoon isn't even needed to stir! Less things to wash for me.<br /><br />All of my kids were eager to try it but sadly, the taste is so off that no one even finished their glass. That's saying a lot since my kids will drink stuff I don't even want to smell. 7 people tried it, including myself, and everyone described it the same way. The first swallow was OK, but it is immediately followed by a strong aftertaste that can only be described as ""medicine-like"". It is a seriously bad taste.<br /><br />Also, everyone needed 3 squirts for it to taste like anything except watered down cough syrup. But then, it just tasted like Kool-aid and cough syrup mixed together.<br /><br />I hope the manufacturers read these reviews and work on the flavor because if it tasted good, I'd buy it by the case. This is exactly the kind of product I've been looking for - if I could only ""swallow"" the awful taste.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Convenient package, flavor less than appealing Like so many low or no-calorie, water flavoring drinks, the Vitamin Squeeze has a cloying artificial sweetener taste, sucralose in this instance.  The Fruit Punch flavor is more reminiscent of Kool Aid than any naturally occurring fruits.  Indeed the ingredients list ambiguously ""natural flavor"".  The shtick on this drink is that it has a few added vitamins (A, C, E, B complex) to give you the illusion of healthfulness.  If this is how you are getting your vitamins, you seriously need to reassess your diet.  Finally, the coup de grace is caffeine.  My favorite drug of choice and peak-me up. There is 40 mg per squeeze.  Roughly 1/3 to 1/2 of a cup of coffee, or half of a 9.5 ounce Red Bull.  Because of the caffeine, this is not a kids drink!<br />The list of ingredients is a series of chemicals (vitamins, artificial sweetener, caffeine, etc.), so how they get away with the ""All Natural"" label is a wonder of modern marketing.  As is the ""natural caffeine"".  As opposed to what?  Artificial caffeine?<br /><br />I am impressed by the packaging genius of this container.  The one squeeze per 8 ounces of water (24 squeezes in the bottle) is super convenient and brilliant means of delivery.  No messy measuring.  If it works for ketchup and mayonnaise, why not for concentrated energy drinks.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink: OK, but this flavor won't be reordered I drink a lot of water, and it can range from the bottled variety to basic tap water, depending on where I am at the time. I also like freshly-squeezed lemonade, which is about as basic a water additive as can be found. Iced tea is also a good basic water changer, as is iced coffee. Am not super picky about the amount of sweetener that is added, as long as it's with some form or real sugar, and not some chemical additive; for some reason they don't seem to agree with me. But lemonade, iced tea and iced coffee all take time to prepare.<br /><br />This <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQMC"">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink</a> in the Fruit Punch flavor presents an interesting and convenient way to alter the flavor of plain tap water for those who like it that way. It's convenient enough: refrigerate it, and then just add one squeeze for each eight ounces of water, as it says on the container. The container also notes that each squeeze adds more flavor and nutrition, and that one container makes 24 servings. It's hard to get more convenient than that.<br /><br />Looking at the container, it proclaims that there are zero calories, zero sugar and zero carbs. It also says:<br /><br />""Vitamin Squeeze(tm) adds Vitamins, Nutrition, and Delicious ALL NATURAL flavor to your drinking water.""<br /><br />And although there are various vitamin additives, there are some small problems, the first being that this bright red drink that resembles <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZRZNMA"">Hawaiian Punch</a> in the Fruit Juicy Red flavor, it really doesn't taste that good, but that's a subjective opinion. And though sometimes one can learn to adapt to a new taste, this product has an aftertaste that lingers, and it's a distinctive taste that seems to dwell in the mouth, the kind that reminds one of an artificial sweetener. And according to the label, that's precisely why that aftertaste is there.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on the product label and the information page here: water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12.  It's not apparent at first, as no brand name jumps out, but there's an ingredient that is probably responsible for the aftertaste: sucralose.<br /><br />Some may not know this, but sucralose is an FDA-approved artificial sweetener which goes by the trade name of Splenda, and most sources agree that it's around 600 times sweeter than sugar, so manufacturers need to use only a small amount. Sucralose shouldn't be confused with sucrose, which is basically table sugar.  While is derived from sugar, sucrose is not a component in this sweetener. Sucralose is made by adding chlorine to sucrose, yet the sucrose itself goes away during the complex manufacturing process.<br /><br />On its positive side, sucralose is found in thousands of food and beverage products.  It's used because it is a no-calorie sweetener, and does not promote dental cavities.  It's also safe for consumption by diabetics, as it doesn't affect insulin levels, and for some can be a good thing.  Did some checking and the safety of sucralose appears to be well documented in more than 100 scientific studies conducted over a 20-year period.  Sucralose has been reviewed by the FDA, as well as by international health authorities such as the World Health Organization.  It is said to be safe for use by all consumers.<br /><br />But iced tea without sweeteners has no calories, and the same goes for iced coffee.  And above all, plain water, be it from a bottle or from the tap is exempt as well.  I'm no health fanatic, and as a cyclist do often indulge in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UYCZN8"">Gatorade</a> sports drinks, which are said to have a small amount of sucralose, depending on the flavor.  As a personal taste, and this is highly subjective, this one didn't work for me, but I'm not ruling this product family out, as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQJU"">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Tropical Citrus</a> may be an improvement in taste.<br /><br />6/21/2012",0,0

Not like a fruit juice, but not like a crystal light either.  It added a bit of flavor that was pleasing.  While it has artificial sweeteners in it, it didn't have *that* aftertaste.

In addition, each squirt provides tons of vitamins as well as caffeine, taurine and electrolytes.<br /><br />I'm trying to drink more water and be healthy, and it is much easier to drink water when you squeeze this great flavoring into it. However, be careful that you don't squeeze into a full glass. You could wind up with the flavoring everywhere, including all over your clothes.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Just a Squeeze is All it Takes Vitamin Squeeze is a good means to improve nutrition and liven up the taste of plain, boring H2O. Just a small squeeze is all it takes to add vitamins and flavor to a glass of water, encouraging better nutrition and more frequent water consumption- two things we could all use more of in our diet.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze is a great idea in concept and it is more economical than purchasing vitamin- enhanced water. It does add some good amounts of key nutrients to your water; namely, Vitamin C, four different B vitamins, chromium, and zinc. It doesn't add any sugar, carbs, fat, or calories so it does have many things going for it from a purely nutritional standpoint and some would be wise to consider it for this reason alone.<br /><br />So, with so much going for it, are there any drawbacks to this beverage enhancement? Yes, there are exactly two and the one that will concern most is the taste. It is fruit punch flavored, but the taste is not very natural and it isn't very appealing. And since it is made with sucrolose, there is a slight aftertaste.<br /><br />The other thing that annoyed me about this beverage is that it doesn't define exactly how much you need to use for a standard serving. The instructions just tell you that one squeeze will do the trick, but it doesn't say how large a squeeze actually is. When you consider there are 12 ounces per bottle and that one bottle is good for 24 servings, you then figure out that a squeeze equals one- half ounce. Also, if you look at the nutrition label, you will see a serving size indicated. Thus, you will eventually figure it out, but it would have been nice if the manufaturer was clearer in this regard.<br /><br />In summary, Vitamin Squeeze isn't the greatest tasting beverage additive, but it doesn't taste terrible and it is still better than a glass of plain water. With the added nutrition and lack of fat, carbs, sugar, or calories, it has enough going for it to recommend and it does make a nice alternative to wasting so much money on individual bottles of vitamin- enhanced water.",0,0

That said, once you get it ""dialed in"", it doesn't taste bad at all. Just like regular fruit punch. I'm not a big fruit punch fan, so it is what it is. But as far as fruit punch goes, it tastes pretty good. I can't speak to the vitamin aspects of it, but I have no reason to doubt what they say is in it.

B006MONQMC,"Better Than Mio, But Not Very Tasty I personally love plain water, and normally would have no problem drinking it plain.  However, the added energy and vitamin C would sometimes be a handy timesaver for me.  I probably won't be purchasing this product for myself, because I hated the taste.  As another reviewer noted, it has a medicine type taste, not to mention a rather long lasting aftertaste.  It may just be an acquired taste, as I tend to dislike artificial sweetener type tastes, though many other people are not bothered by them.<br /><br />I tried with little success to vary the amount used, thinking perhaps a smaller squirt would be better.  However, it's tough to squirt from this bottle, and it tended to be a large serving each time.

This drink requires a fair amount of finesse as there's no real margin for error.<br /><br />Beyond that, it tastes really fake. Like watered down kool aid infused with one of those vitamins that's not supposed to have an after taste but does. This drink is supposed to be an easier way to get your vitamins, but it certainly is not.<br /><br />I don't recommend this drink to anyone. It's possible that some people may enjoy this taste.

B006MONQMC,"Value of this water enhancer is limited There's 40 mg of caffeine in an 8 ounce serving of this drink, which is about half-way between the amount in 8 ounces of green and black tea.  If you're watching your intake of caffeine, there is a problem with that amount.  Consider this perspective:  An 8 oz. cup of tea is an average serving for a morning or afternoon ""cuppa"".  But 8 oz. of water mixed with this water enhancer is NOT going to be an average serving.  You or your child will be sucking down way more than 8 ounces at a time.  And that means you will be ingesting a good amount of caffeine (and Vitamin C).  If that works for your body, well then, fine.  But it doesn't work for children and it usually doesn't work for older people.  So consider that before hitting that ""Add to Cart"" button.  And, I may be wrong, but haven't I read somewhere that an over abundance of Vitamin C is not good for you?<br /><br />Other observations:  Good:  I liked the taste much better than I like Mio and I didn't detect an unpleasant aftertaste.  Bad:  The fact that the bottle is 12 ounces big and you have to store it in the frig after opening will prevent me from carrying it around in my purse, briefcase or the console of my vehicle.<br /><br />I think there are much better ways to get my Vitamin C and if I need a waker-upper, I'll have a cup of tea.

Another example of a product in this category is ZipFizz.<br /><br />After reading all the negative reviews of this product I had really low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. It tasted decent (no better or worse than most energy drinks). The mixture I made gave me heaps of caffeine-induced energy and alertness.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that it's hard to measure what a ""squeeze"" is. After I did my ""squeeze"" into my water, I looked at the lines on the side of the bottle and saw that I had actually ""squeezed"" four servings into my glass. At this rate, the bottle that is supposed to have 24 servings is only going to last me about 6 servings. What is odd is that my drink seemed to have just enough flavor for what I squirted in. Perhaps I used more water that the recommended amount.<br /><br />Just as a heads-up, one serving of this product has 40mg of caffeine, or roughly that of a diet Coke.

Even adding it to a glass of already made crystal light punch, you could taste a grainy after taste. There are 24 servings in a bottle and it advises to keep for only 30 days - refrigerated after you open it.

B006MONQMC,"Contains Sucralose - artificial sweetener & 40mg natural caffeine per serving Drinking 6 to 8 12oz bottles of water a day I always look forward to something that might spice it up without adding calories or sugar to the mix, but I also know that if it does, it usually has an artificial sweetener in it.  Vitamin s Squeeze Energy Drink is no exception.  It contains sucralose - an artificial sweetener 600x's sweeter than sucrose (granulated sugar), per Wikipedia's info.  While no serious health risks are associated with sucralose, it does contain fillers.  It is found in Splenda and other artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Studies on rats being given doses of sucralose did note a 50% drop in good bacteria in their intestines.  What does that mean for humans?  No studies have been done, but like with most things, moderate intake of this sweetener should have no negative affects.  Just be aware it's part of the deal, and if you prefer natural sweeteners like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q4SW36"">Stevia Spoonable-50pkts - 50 ct - Packet</a>, you may want to avoid this product.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is a water enhancer (sort of a funny way of saying 'flavor changer'), does it, but the 'energy' jolt that others speak of is something I've yet to experience with this product.  'Natural' caffeine... not sure whether that's different than the good 'ol generic variety, but if it is, it may be the 'light' version.<br /><br />The product's label indicates that you get 120% of your daily Vitamin C intake in one serving (a squirt in 8 ounces of water). Each bottle provides enough Vitamin Squeeze for 24, 8oz. glasses of water.  The resulting drink has 120% of your daily recommendation of vitamin C, 40% of your daily recommendation of 'B' vitamins including B3, B5, B6 and B12. 40mg of natural caffeine per serving, 10mg of Taurine, with electrolytes and Potassium to help you recover from excessive sweating. (Like most sports drinks - Gatorade for one.)<br /><br />Adding more 'C' and 'B' to your system is never a bad thing, particularly if you exercise, it's hot out and you're sweating a lot, or you just want to boost your immune system. (Bear in mind these are water-based vitamins and you'll pee them out of your system rapidly, so a dose of 120% of your daily recommended isn't really all that much over the course of your day.)<br /><br />The 'natural' caffeine at 40mg should be similar to drinking a cup and a half of coffee.  If you are like me and drink a lot of caffeine on a regular basis, you probably won't notice a boost from this product.  However, if you don't usually drink caffeinated drinks, you may get this pick-me-up.  I didn't notice a thing.<br /><br />No calories. How? Artificial sweetener Sucralose.  In higher doses (like one too many Vitamin Squeezes...) you'll feel it in your upset tummy and colon.  The B and C vitamins would add to that affect.<br /><br />No sugar = no carbs.  Sugar in any form is a carbohydrate.  They are synonymous.  This makes this product good for those on low carb diets or for diabetics - in theory, but be aware that artificial sweeteners have their own negatives.<br /><br />The squeeze package is easy to use, and better than most for not making a mess, however if you are using a bottle larger than 8 ounces, you may want to give it two squeezes to get any flavor.<br /><br />The sniff test on this one made me think of Hawaiian Punch.  However the flavor isn't strong, and for me, barely perceptible with 2 squeezes in a 12 ounce bottle of water.  Definitely not sugary or sweet in any way, but not bad tasting either.  It changes the flavor, but again, it was such a minor change I wondered 'Why bother?'.<br /><br />Some will really like this product.  It's definitely not going to harm you if you have a couple of these drinks a day, and might actually assist some in their weight loss efforts with the caffeine, Chromium and Taurine in it.  For me though, it's not enough of anything special for me to want to buy it and keep using it.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Yummy Hawaiian Punch Smell; Light Hawaiian Punch Taste.  Or add more for stronger flavor. I liked this.  Depending on price, I would buy it again.  It smells great---just like the Hawaiian punch I had so often as a child.  A little hard to assess how much a serving is (one squeeze?), so I just experimented for the  amount of flavor I wanted.  A smidge...or more.  Depending on my mood.  Flexible flavoring. If you (as I often might) just want a smidge of flavor (akin to the level of a lemon in your water) this will last much longer than the 24 servings that are predicted on the label.  Although it's less portable (bc of it's size, it's more than I personally want to carry in a purse) I like this better than the Crystal Light type water flavorings.  Loved the smell!  :)  Enjoy!",1,1
B006MONQMC,Not Much Of A Thirst Quencher............... I like that this easy to use product adds vitamins to water without adding calories or anything else I don't want too much of in my body.  The taste is OK if a little bit like the flavors used in childrens' medicines.  In fact this fruit punch flavor kind of reminded me of the taste of a classic children's cherry asprin if it was dissolved in water.  The big draw back to me is it did nothing to quench my thirst and actually made me thirstier so I had to chase it with a couple of glasses of plain water.  I guess drinking more water is a good thing too........,0,-1
B006MONQMC,"Convenient flavored sugar free hydration works for me I drink sugar free beverages exclusively. What this means is that I'm pretty immune to typical aftertastes for such products so take that in to account when considering my review.<br /><br />I hydrate regularly throughout the day by filling up a coffee mug with water from our refrigerated drinking fountain. One squirt of this gives me a touch of flavor and a boost of nutrition, or so says the marketing literature on this and I'm not arguing. It tastes like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019MMQXM"">Kool Aid</a> to me, i.e., pleasantly sweet but not overpowering. If you add an extra squirt or use less water you'll get a stronger and (artificially) sweeter flavor.<br /><br />As a reviewer who received this as a sample I always ask, ""would I buy this with my own money?"" Probably not. Still, it's pleasant enough and if slightly flavored beverage water is something you like, this is a very convenient way to use it. I keep this in the mini-fridge at work, and when I fill up my mug with icy drinking fountain water (I love our drinking fountain) I occasionally throw in a squirt of this Fruit Punch flavored package as a change of pace from, um, just water.<br /><br />I might suggest if  you are a Kool Aid household, that this is a much more convenient mechanism of flavor delivery than powder. Not a big deal, but there you have it.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Good alternative to buying cases of Vitiman Water but has artificial sweetner taste. I think this is a great idea to make a concentrate because you buy this one small bottle and just add one squirt it to an entire glass of water over and over again for 24 glasses!.  I really thought the flavor is perfect and strong enough with one squirt in each glass.  Any more than that and it is really too strong and too much.  So this really does make 24 servings and I like that it has four B vitimans-40% of earch of these (B5 B6 B3 and B12) , Vitamin C 120% and 10% of both Chromium and Zinc.  I do not love the artificial sweetner taste but if you like punch this is just what you are probably used to. Also it really beats the hastle of buying a case of Vitiman waters and lugging it all over.  No more heavy lifting so you decide!",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Quite a delicious surprise. I imagined Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink would taste like watered down gatorade or koolaid without sugar, but this stuff is fairly sweet. I think the directions are a bit vague but one squeeze per 8 oz of fluid was right on for flavoring. I enjoy this in place of a soda or juice as it has vitamins C, B6 B12, B6 and A and still manages to taste great.<br /><br />I am not a fan of other water additives (or I should say THE OTHER water additive) but I really do like this Vitamin Squeeze. My only complaint is for the packaging, the plastic around the lid was brittle and actually ripped up the side of the bottle, and the disc sealing the fluid inside did not want to come off, I eventually cut it off.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink The flavor is light mostly like watered down Gatorade, so I tried a 2 second squeeze and it tasted better.  It contains sucralose which is less harmful than other artificial sweeteners - as for me, I might need to control this drink since sucralose makes me crave sugar.<br /><br />I had a good drink today after a hard day of work outside in the hot weather and it felt refreshing.  It was a good pick me up without the phenylalanine of a diet coke.<br /><br />This is an easier way to take vitaminc C and also the B vitamins that I already take.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Delivers as an Energy Drink I'm drinking it right now, and I really like the flavor. It does seem to leave a tangy, fruity aftertaste, which lingers on my tongue and cheeks for quite some time.<br /><br />Each bottle turns twenty-four 8oz. glasses of water into an energy fruit punch packed with 120% of your daily recommendation of vitamin C, along with a 40% combination of vitamins B3, B5, B6 and B12. Each serving also features 40mg of natural caffeine, 10mg of Taurine and it has electrolytes for rapid refreshment.<br /><br />I like this Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer. I like the flavor but I'm not too excited about how it lingers. The label shows orange, cherry, pineapple and raspberries, but the mixed drink's color resembles that of watermelon juice. It's very tasty and it certainly doesn't get much easier to make than to stir it into some water and be done with it.<br /><br />I've got a bit of the caffeine and vitamin B buzz going already...that's quite effective! With the main purpose of this mix being another option in the energy drink market, then it does its job well.<br /><br />I noticed a couple of drops got onto my shirt. Despite my efforts, I now have two stain spots that do not want to come out. I guess be careful when your stirring not to have any splash over the glass rim - it's my fault, but still.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Enjoyable Lately my family has really been enjoying the powdered single serve additives to make water into lemonade or punch or other flavors so I knew that they'd like this one. They do and I like that I don't have to open those little packets. Just one squeeze from this bottle sweetens the water and there are 24 servings per package. And extra bonus? Instead of just sugar like the other drink additives my family has tried in the past, this one has 120%  Vitamin C per serving, as well as other vitamins and minerals. (the only downside to giving this to kids is that it DOES contain caffeine but that's one of the reasons it is labelled an ""energy"" drink)<br /><br />All in all, it's easy to use, tastes good and even infuses the water with some vitamins that are good for you. As a diet coke ""addict"", I am hoping to cut down on the amount of Diet Coke I consumer and switch it out for more water. It is much easier and tasty to choose water when this drink mix is added and 0 calories, sugar, or carbs are added!",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Great Tasting and healthy! When I first got this I was thinking it would be loaded with Sugar and calories, and then I was very happy to see that it had no Calories, Fat, Sugar, Carbs, just vitamins!  So I then started to think that this will mean it will not have much taste, and then yet again, super surprised!  With just a little squeeze the water had an amazing berry taste!  It was delicious!  It tasted better than most fruit drinks!  It has a load of vitamins and taste great and has nothing bad in it (calories, fat or sugar)!  It also has a nice spout on it that makes the liquid only come out when you squeeze (you can hold it upside down and nothing will come out until you squeeze)!!!<br /><br />I was extremely surprised at how great this tastes and that it has no calories, sugar, or fat!  I love the ease of squeezing a little (a little goes a long way) and then drinking it (no stirring or shaking), it has a great taste and gives you a great does of vitamins (mainly C) in an easy and convenient manner!  Highly recommend!!!",1,1
B006MONQMC,"I Like It....... I wasn't sure what to expect when I received this product and got ready to try it.  The instructions were to squeeze the bottle once for 8 ounces of water.  I had a 16 ounce bottle and added two squeezes, unfortunately I squeezed to hard.  The bottle doesn't indicate how hard to squeeze so you need to just give it a quick squeeze.<br />After the initial try of putting in too much I was able to get the correct amount in and it tastes great to me.  I am used to diet drinks so the ""after taste"" doesn't bother me, I'm used to it.<br /><br />I purchase Vitamin Water and drink occasionally and this is right up there with it in taste.  For me the vitamins and Energy are an added benefit and the tropical punch tastes great.  It definitely helps me get my daily required amount of water.  I Like it.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tasty I do not drink ""energy"" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.  Energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be ""energy"" drinks, and this stuff also has taurine in it.  One can also taste the sucralose.  It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.<br /><br />The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red ""moustache"" on my upper lip.  The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this!<br /><br />Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.  For the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents, this isn't a bad-tasting mixture.  I haven't felt a ""zing"" after drinking this, though.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"I'm Impressed - this is pretty darn good. A little goes a long way and this does not taste bad at all, in fact I liked it. Not too sweet and no weird aftertaste like many of these energy/supplement potions have. As is in a glass of water or to give a nice boost to juice - I particularly liked it in o.j.<br /><br />Since I can not digest B vitamins in tablet form this is a particularly great way for me to get my B's in without an upset stomach. The dose is low enough I can drink it more than once a day. And at 12 oz, there is plenty to get through a week or two.<br /><br />Enjoying it & I will be getting this again.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Convenient but Flavor is So-so Vitamin squeeze is a water enhancer like Mio. I tried this in the Fruit Punch flavor which isn't my favorite flavor. You add one squeeze for each 8-oz of water. I had a large glass of water and added several squeezes and it still seemed weak.<br /><br />I like that it has zero calories, sugar and carbs and the added vitamins. It does have caffeine; combined with the B vitamins is the reason for the Energy claim so be aware of this if drinking later in the afternoon or giving to children.<br /><br />Another note: make sure the lid is on tight. You have to remove it to take the safety seal off and when I replaced it, it wasn't completely tight so when I squeezed it into my water, it went everywhere and stained everything it touched.<br /><br />Overall, it's great for convenience but the flavor and strength was so-so.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Great Value, Ingredients and Taste First, at 12oz per bottle, you've got plenty of wow per squeeze. It works out to be about $6 a bottle, which is really a great deal. The vitamin C and just enough caffeine (40) really gives you a `gentle' boost instead of the wall-climbing-overdose followed by a big crash. It still tastes great even with zero calories.<br />I seriously like this a lot. Can't wait to try the others, esp. peach.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Love the idea, but haven't warmed up to the flavor The many different water flavor enhancers coming out these days have become a staple in my family's cupboard, and it's always a pleasure to try new ones. Unfortunately I'm a bit torn on this one, as it has all the added vitamins I love, but the flavor is a bit lacking.<br /><br />This particular Vitamin Squeeze has a very light fruit punch flavor, and it isn't nearly as strong as regular Kool-Aid or even Crystal Light. I found that even putting three or four squeezes into a glass of water still ended up with a very bland taste that isn't particularly exciting.  On the upside, there's a lot more liquid than in the smaller Mio bottles, and this Vitamin Squeeze flavor is completely sugar free.<br /><br />What sets Vitamin Squeeze apart is that it has both Vitamin C (meaning it can take the place of EmergenC or similar powders) and good deal of B vitamins, a standard of energy drinks. You can essentially create your own energy water by upping just how many ""squeezes"" you feel like using in any given glass. If you hate the taste of energy drinks and are looking for something a bit healthier, this is a great alternative, and since there's no sugar and only a small amount of caffeine it doesn't create that jittery feeling.<br /><br />This is definitely worth trying if you want a new way to add some flavor to regular tap water, but overall I didn't like it nearly as much as Mio the tried and true Crystal Light.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Delicious I love this stuff.  Squeeze this bottle into an ordinary water bottle, and you can flavor more or less to how you enjoy the strength of the fruit punch taste.I like a lot. It has zero everything in it! Tastes very good. I did have to pour some water out of my bottle in order to add the flavor liquid. My kids tasted it, they approved how good it is.",1,1
B006MONQMC,I really like this. I really enjoy this.  I get a lot out of this product.  I am unsure of what benefits I would gain in the long run since this product is new for me and I will get back to you on that but other than that this reminds me of MIO.  I love MIO,1,1
B006MONQMC,"Easy to use with great taste I have really enjoyed this fruit punch mix.  It's got a much better flavor than other similar offerings (such as the MIO product line) and it doesn't taste overwhelmingly of artificial sweetners.  The flavor is comparable to most other ""fruit punch"" flavors on the market.  It mixes well with cold water and blends well with little stirring.  I'd recommend it as an alternative to water.  I will caution that it is on the sweet side, but it can be diluted to taste.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Delicious but ""good for you"" is debatable The vitamin line-up on this is pretty good.  120% of Vitamin C is something of a waste, since the body does not store Vit C - it excretes what it doesn't need/use right away.  Still, I'd rather know I'm getting more than I need than not enough.  40% of most of the B vitamins is pretty decent, since B should also be obtained throughout the day as part of the daily diet.<br /><br />The pros:  I gave this to my kids to try and they pronounce it ""delicious"" and ""you should get some more"".<br />The cons:  A ""squeeze"" is too non-specific for me.  One person's ""squeeze"" is a few drops while another's is half the bottle.  This renders the nutritional info pretty worthless - who really knows what percent of the daily allowance is consumed each time my kids ""squeeze"" the bottle?  The other con is that this is chock-a-block FULL of food coloring.  I avoid coloring in my own diet and have attempted to minimize my kids' consumption of it too, but here is this product designed to add vitamins to the diet and that can't be accomplished without adding a bunch of food coloring?  For shame!",0,1
B006MONQMC,"makes my water more enjoyable! I have been drinking vitamin water and sobe Lifewater for awhile but that can get expensive so I started drinking just plain water, filtered from my fridge's water dispenser.  Plain water is so boring so when I saw this I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />First of all, remember that this is concentrated!  so you MUST mix it with water.  When I got it I wasn't really sure how big of a ""squeeze"" to put in.  It says on the label ""one squeeze per 8 oz water""  - well, my first 'squeeze' I just did a full grip and squeezed until I couldn't squeen anymore.  For me that was a bit too much flavor and it tasted like Hawaiian Punch.  So the next time I backed off a bit and after a few uses I found a ""squeeze"" level that works for me tastes.<br /><br />I also like to add it to small bottles of water that I occasionally get from the store.  I just drink a little out of a 16.9oz water bottle then put in a squeeze of the Vitamin squeeze, shake it a bit and I've got a nice, flavorful and vitamin-enhanced drink.  I'm not too sure there are 24 servings in one bottle, maybe my squeeze is too much, but I've probably had at least a dozen water drinks with this one bottle and still have some left.  I'll try keeping tabs with the next bottle I open and update this review.<br /><br />Oh, I enjoyed the fruit punch so much that I decided to try the Acai Grape Pomegranate and the Tropical Citrus.  The Acai Grape Pomegranate is okay, but I think the Tropical Citrus and the Fruit punch are my favorites thus far.  The Tropical Citrus is a bit like ""Sunny Delight"" - if you've ever tried that.<br /><br />As for the claim of ""Specially designed cap delivers the right amount in one squeeze with no drips or mess"" - I would say again that you have to determine what ""one squeeze"" is to suit your taste and it definitely is no drips or mess!  A lot better than pouring those powder packets in to a bottle and getting the powder on your counter top or desk.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Be prepared to wear it! Oh heck no, not happy at all.  I have used the similar MIO water enhancers, and enjoy them.  They are only 1.6 oz bottles, and this is 12 ounces.  Obviously you need to shake this, then though for some reason they want you to store it upside down, you turn it up and flip open the cap.  On my first attempt, the bright red liquid shot out freely, spilled all over the place and stained everything it touched, including my now ruined shirt.  I wiped it off the floor, counter and walls, cleaned, and then took the closed bottle and washed it under water.  I blamed it on user error, and was more cautious on my next attempt. But, before you even turn it over it starts coming out.  Dare to actually squeeze it, you get too much, and some of it might end up in the glass if you're lucky.<br /><br />So, once you are out of energy after cleaning the mess, once again, you take a sip and now can't describe what you are drinking.  It just tastes like plastic to me.  Reading the ingredients, I have no idea what is causing the plastic taste, so it must be the plastic bottle.  The taste is eventually tolerable, but not so much.  The MIO bottle is ten times smaller and lasts longer, with better taste.  But honestly, this is the stupidest bottle I have ever seen.  Do not store on it's lid as it will spill all over your fridge. I have it upright in a can holder. If you have kids, forget it. You will be cleaning this up endlessly.",-1,-1

I was using a mug to drink from and even though I had this totally upside down it managed to go everywhere! I think just a tiny hole would make it easier and less messy to use. I didn't try this with a water bottle so I assume that would be easier to dispense. Also, with water in my mug I could add more water if I added too much of the drink.<br />I didn't feel energized at any time after drinking this product. The added vitamins can only enhance my diet so I like this aspect. The vitamin content is only 40% for the B (3, 5, 6, 12) and 120% for Vitamin C and 10% for Chromium and Zinc.

B006MONQMC,"Great alternative to sugary drinks The Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer is a really great alternative to sweet, sugary drinks. It comes in a plastic squeeze bottle, and all you do is give a single squeeze into each 8 oz. of water. Be sure to shake well before each squeeze, and in my experience even when I had the cap open (I did this right over a sink to avoid any accidents) and shook it vigorously, none of the liquid came out. It actually has to be squeezed to come out, or at least mine did. The fruit punch tastes fine, and depending on how much you are actually putting in the flavor can be very, very subtle or fairly detectable. What it basically comes down to is about the level of Vitamin Water or Gatorade in terms of how prominent the taste is. In my opinion it tastes a little sweeter and a little tastier than those. Because you're squeezing it into water, that's a pretty good analogy to think of how it tastes: this is just a slightly sweeter version of Vitamin Water. With each serving (single squeeze) you'll get 120% of your daily Vitamin C and 40% each of Vitamins B3, B5, B6, and B12. The great thing is that it also has 0 Calories and 0 grams of sugar. That's right...no sugar. You also get 40 mg of natural caffeine, 10 mg of taurine, and electrolytes. Compare that to Gatorade or Vitamin Water and suddenly this is looking really good if you want to cut down on your sugar intake; take a look at one of those bottles next time, I was shocked to see how much sugar is in them. Personally I do not get any extra noticeable energy from the caffeine, but I am notoriously resistant to energy stuff. I don't drink tea or coffee, although I do have roughly a one-can-per-day cream soda habit, and I'm guessing that my relative lack of daily caffeine is what makes it so hard for any energy supplements to work on me...or maybe that's just me. Anyway, take a look at a can of cream soda and you'll find that unfortunately one can exceeds the daily recommendation of sugar intake. I'm happy and proud to say that over the last week or so that I've had this squeeze bottle, I have only had one can of soda and have opted instead the other times to get a glass of water and squeeze some of this enhancer into it when I'm craving a sweet beverage. Will it get me off cream soda? No, I don't want it to. I love cream soda and I do still wan to have a delicious can from time to time. But will it help me lower my average daily sugar intake big-time? Yes, and that makes it something that I can very much recommend to you.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tasty vitamin and energy drink For a water drink enhancer, I think the taste is great.  The fruit punch flavor tastes like pop cycles to me.  There's 120% of the vitamin C  that's required, 4 of the vitamins B's, electrolytes, and Taurine.  I've been reading about all the benefits of Taurine, so many good reasons to have that in your diet.  With the electrolytes, it's like a sports drink too.<br />What I learned the hard way, was to not drink it close to bedtime.  Big mistake, if you want to go to sleep.  The drink is much milder than many of the poplar energy drinks, but still gives me an added boost without the jitters that I get from those other energy drinks.  For the taste and cost, you get a lot of bang for your buck, so I give it 5 stars.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Delicious This fruit punch flavor is delicious! It tastes like Kool-Aid, but without all the sugar AND it has vitamins.

I truly feel that after drinking this everyday for one week that I did have spurts of energy throughout the day.

So if you have cold water, you can probably tote it anywhere and be satisfied with the product.<br /><br />Yes, you want to shake it well before using it (as directed).<br /><br />The only thing I noticed that might be unpleasant was that it has a ""dry"" aftertaste.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Caution: not for children (or maybe adults) The first problem is the bottle.  It has to be shaken before each use and the lid doesn't fit tightly enough to prevent leaking. Red stuff all over my white floor.<br /><br />Instructions say ""not for children"". Unless you want them wacked out on caffeine and taurine. Taurine can possibly  act as blood thinner and you should consult your doctor if you're epleptic or before taking with other medications, especially during chemo.<br /><br />Refrigerate and use within 30 days.<br /><br />The flavor is ""fruit punch"". It reminds me of a weak cherry cough syrup with undertones of gasoline. Some people seem to love it so maybe it's just me.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes fantastic I've tried MIO and Crystal Lite. I like Crystal Lite when making gallons, can't stand MIO. I wanted something affordable and tasty for my water bottles - those pouches are costly - so a quirt bottle would be the ideal solution - that's why I tried several flavors of MIO. I decided to give this a try - mainly for the flavor - energy and vitamins are just a plus. This tastes like sugary cool-aid - without the calories. One squirt flavors 8oz strongly - since it's a liquid you flavor to your liking, and experiment with the strength. My girlfriend is pickier than I am, and does not like overly sweet drinks  - but she liked it as well.<br /><br />So this gets a definite thumbs-up. It's also larger than expected. I pictured a MIO bottle - this is closer to a Red Bull in size. In other words you get a lot of it! They advertise that it can flavor 22 drinks. If you like it less sweet, this would be closer to 30! The liquid resembles V8.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes pretty good, watch the caffeine content! This is a nice idea. Squirt some liquid into regular water and get some good vitamins. The taste of the drink is pretty good and doesn't taste like liquid vitamins, which normally have a metallic taste.  It is much better if you make sure your water has ice in it. I found that if I put 2 squirts or perhaps 3 into an 8 ounce glass, the taste improved and became richer in flavor. The problem with this is that you're adding more caffeine to the drink, which I realized at midnight when I still couldn't sleep several hours after drinking this. The lack of precise measurement is a bit frustrating too. The instructions say ""just a squirt"", but the bottle doesn't stop the flow of concentrate and you could literally empty the bottle in one squeeze. I wish the bottle required an additional squeeze for each additional portion but it does not. Overall, I like the idea of adding vitamins to my diet, and the flavor of the drink is quite good. But use with caution.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamin Taste This product is like other products in several ways. Let me explain. Let's start with the bottle. It is larger than Mio, but it operates in the same way. You squeeze it and it flavors your water. However, this has to be refrigerated after opening and used within 30 days, and as far as I know, Mio does not. As far as the flavor goes, it is comparable to Emergen-C, which is nasty to me. It tastes way too much like vitamins. I'd rather swallow a pill. I was not impressed with the ""natural caffine"" because I have not felt any improvement in my energy from drinking this. Overall, this is not a product I would purchase.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Makes sense Lots of vitamins. Predicatably tastes like Kool-aid. I drink a lot of iced tea with no sweetener so this is a nice change and it seems as good or better than more expensive drinks. I can just add a couple tea bags to a gallon of water in the fridge and I have iced tea. This is a nice change. And, I like the vitamins.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Product works fine -- but do you need it? I drink a lot of water every day and there are times when I have to spike it with a shot of cranberry or orange juice or sugarfree lemonade to give it some taste.  This product offers the same kind of solution with a squirt recommended for 8 oz of plain water.  The taste that results is pleasant and sweet, kind of like cherry KoolAid crossed with a berry flavored Emergency C powder.  This squeeze bottle is portable and offers a good dose of Vitamin C.  Do you need the product?  Well, I don't really and wouldn't purchase it, preferring my method of adding a bit of juice.  Another downside to Vitamin Squeeze is the caffeine content.  Why that's necessary I don't know.  If you need caffeine to do what you have to do, then do something else.  Another real disadvantage of the product is its packaging.  Very hard to open.  For portability it makes more sense to get a single serving Crystal Light.  Better taste, no caffeine.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Very Pleasant Tasting Prior to receiving this product from Amazon, I have drank Vitamin Water.  It too has a bit of an after taste of vitamins.  BUT, it is not unpleasant so I really enjoyed Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)  I also believe it will be much cheaper than the plastic bottles I buy.  My touchy stomach has not been upset so I find this a plus.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)is without calories but packed full of vitamins.  I am so lousy about taking mine that I will let this liquid form be my new attempt to be more vigilant.<br /><br />Very nice product.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"My kids liked it I love having something to get some Vitamin C into my kids during cold season especially.  This contains not only Vitamin C, but also a bunch of B vitamins, and caffeine.  I'm not excited about giving my kids caffeine, but early enough in the day I can certainly make that work.<br /><br />The taste?  It got two thumbs up from everyone, basically tasting like any other ""fruit punch"" beverage out there.<br /><br />It was super-easy to make -- just squeeze (one squeeze for 8 oz of water) and the force of the liquid coming out pretty well mixed the beverage.  No additional stirring was necessary.<br /><br />Once the bottle has been opened, it needs to be stored in the fridge and should be used within 30 days.  With 5 kids, I know I won't have a problem using it.<br /><br />The kids voted that I should purchase more, and maybe try some other flavors.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"A Quick Squirt I opened the package and found that the squirt nozzle (for use of a better word) was slightly blocked by plastic, which I had to remove.  That was most likely a manufacturing error from incomplete plastic molding.<br /><br />Shot a couple of squirts into cold water and drank.  The taste is a bit too sweet, slight metallic taste.  However I feel pretty good once taking it; not in an energy sort of way but just a good feeling.  I usually take this with my morning vitamins so it's hard to tell whether it's the beverage or the vitamin.<br /><br />This product is not taken straight!  Must dilute it.<br /><br />Recommended.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Not to shabby...taste pretty good, wouldn't rely on as an energy drink. Overall I like this drink. I like the fact that it is zero calories, and it's a way for me to get a taste of sweet without the calories. I'm not sure I felt extra energy the way I do with an energy drink, but as a drink it's pretty good. The one word of warning, the first time I squirted it, I put it in a glass with ice, and the concentrate hit an ice cube and splashed off the cube and onto me. So just be careful when squirting.",1,0
B006MONQMC,Mild flavor but pretty good punch I'm pretty impressed with this product. It has a nice mild flavor but it's packed with vitamins and it even has some good ole caffeine and tourine in it.<br /><br />It's not a strong flavor which I kind of wouldn't mind it being stronger at least more noticeable but overall it seems to be a very good product.,1,0
B006MONQMC,"Fruity Taste, Not Artificial Like Others. I am NOT a plain water drinker.  Even bottled water needs some enhancement for me.  While the best and most natural way to enhance the flavor of plain water is by squeezing fresh lemon or lime or orange into it, that tends to get boring AND expensive.  I received my 12 oz bottle of Fruit Punch flavored Vitamin Squeeze Energy a couple of days ago.  This product is housed in the upside down type bottles that are currently popular.  The top of the bottle features a snap lid that allows you to squeeze the product out slowly or quickly and it also allows you to turn the cap so it is removed entirely if you prefer to pour the product in a larger pitcher of water.<br /><br />I have tried other water enhancer products such as the one that is spelled with a certain 3 letters.  I did not care for those as they had left a weird chemical taste in my mouth.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Vitamin Squeeze.  This did not taste in any way to me like a no cal product.  I squeezed about 1/2 of a tablespoon into a 12 oz glass of filtered water and I thought I was drinking a watered down version of Hi-C fruit punch. All I tasted was fruit.  I didn't taste any diet sweetener at all.<br /><br />I looked at the differences in the ingredient labels of Vitamin Squeeze and that other enhancer brand I mentioned above.  Vitamin Squeeze does not have any ingredients I cannot pronounce nor any that I am not familiar with.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients listed in order on the bottle:<br /><br />Water<br />Citric Acid (not Malic Acid like in other enhancers)<br />Vitamin C<br />Natural Flavor<br />Sucralose<br />Natural Caffeine<br />Sodium Benzoate<br />Potassium Sorbate<br />Magnesium Lactate (Electrolyte)<br />Vitamin B3<br />Taurine (ingredient in an energy drink known to give you ""wings"")<br />Vitamin B5<br />Calcium Lactate<br />Potassium Phosphate<br />Gum Ascacia<br />Glyceryl Abietate<br />Red 40<br />Vitamin B6<br /><br />Now, the ingredients that are giving you energy are the Taurine, the natural caffeine (but I don't know the source of the ""natural"" caffeine) and the B Vitamins.  The Electrolytes I understand as well.  The only ingredient problem I have with this product is the Red #40.  WHY do we have to have this product colored?  Is it a psychological thing?  I would be happy to drink my water CLEAR.  As long as there is some flavor in it I do not need to psych myself into thinking I am drinking something other than water by making it a different color.<br /><br />When I first opened this bottle and started squeezing I found leaks around the bottom edge of the screw on cap.  I was getting irritated and was going to blast the design in my review.  Then I started to think about it and unscrewed the cap.  When I first opened the protective paper opening I had only torn a triangle around 1/3 of the paper.  This was what was causing the leakage.  Remove the ENTIRE opening protector and you won't have the problem I had.  However, that said, when you are squeezing the bottle into a glass hold the bottle completely vertical because you will get a surprise squirt rebound if you don't.  LOL.  This product will stain your clothing and counter and floor.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this product.  Have I noticed an energy boost?  I don't know really but at least I am not getting a crash like after drinking other well known canned energy drinks.  I will keep using it and update this review if I have any issues with it.  I would give it 5 stars but I don't like the coloring and the fact that it stains everything so 4 stars it is.<br /><br />EDIT 3/23/12:  The lid STILL leaks even with the paper protection completely removed.  I guess I just won't store the bottle upside down in the fridge but be wary if you are going to transport it in a purse or tote!",1,1
B006MONQMC,"A shoddy bottle design and meh taste kill off its appeal I like stuff that you can add to water, so I was a bit excited to taste this. It boasted a lot of positives: vitamins, caffeine (yay!), and electrolytes. I like feeling like I'm getting more than just a flavoring, so the idea behind this sounded pretty good.<br /><br />Then I actually got the product.<br /><br />First the taste. It's meh. It's hard to mess up fruit punch, but this is just sort of bland. There's no *punch* to this punch and it has that strange aftertaste that you get when you use certain sweeteners or add vitamins to it. I was expecting this to a degree, but when it's mixed in with the lack of pow in the fruit punch it's very noticeable.<br /><br />Now for the packaging. This is just horribly designed overall. The first thing is that this is HUGE, about the size of a small bottle of soda. It's not very easy to carry with you and when it comes to exercise and such, you need portability and this bottle doesn't have it. It's good in a way since you have a lot of the product if you're really into it, but if you're hoping to have something small like a Mio bottle or a packet of Crystal Light that you can slip into your purse or bag, this isn't that item. Then there's getting into the darned thing. The pull tab under the cap is as easy as ""pull and peel"" as it claims to be. I had to use my nails to claw this off, which was just a little irritating. This in itself isn't a deal breaker like the bottle's size might be for some people, but it is aggravating.<br /><br />In the end this just didn't wow me enough to where I'd really want to buy this when the current bottle runs out. I can see where it could be good for someone who is dying to have the electrolytes and such, but there's got to be something better out drink-wise there that's sugar-free and low/no calorie. Flavor-wise, stick to your Crystal Light and Mio bottles. I'm giving it an additional star for the vitamins and stuff that it has with it, but otherwise this is just sort of a flop for me.",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"It's OK... I made a New Year's resolution, this year, to not drink any pop. I'm about three months in, and have had no failings up to this point. I drink lots of water, and good old H2O is just about perfect. Still, there are some times I want a little more flavor, so I reach for the juice or some Crystal Light packets (the ones that are sized for water bottles). This Vitamin Squeeze product gives me another drink choice that is on the healthy side of the equation.<br /><br />The drink, itself, tastes quite a bit like Crystal Light drinks. So, if you enjoy those, you should enjoy this product as well. The price tag on this product is kind of high, but you do get (supposedly) 24 servings out of this squeeze bottle, as it only takes one squeeze to make a single serving. I have my doubts that it will stretch that far, but we'll see. I could be wrong.<br /><br />I found this product to be fine. It's nothing fantastic, but I wasn't disappointed with it, either. If you're into these sorts of beverage options, you'll probably like it. If you are more into pop or other carbonated beverages, you probably won't like it so much.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Between plain water and soda The idea of this product is good.  It offers a no-calorie alternative to sugar or diet sodas as well as bottled or tap water.  The product is designed to turn water into a more flavorful beverage.  It is cleverly designed so that one squeeze of the bottle injects just the right amount of enhancer to flavor an 8-ounce glass of water.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor is extremely sweet, so I'd suggest adding a half squeeze first to see how it tastes before committing to a full squeeze.  The liquid is fortified with Vitamin C, four B vitamins, natural caffeine, and electrolytes.  The caffeine is intended to give you the same shot that coffee or cola provides.<br /><br />For those who are trying to wean themselves from soda or calorie-rich fruit juices, Vitamin Squeeze is an alternative worth investigating.  The 12-ounce container has enough liquid for 24 servings.  You can eke out more servings if you don't want too sweet a drink.<br /><br />Be careful opening the container.  It has an inner seal.  If you don't remove it VERY carefully, you'll spill some of the liquid and it is VERY sticky.  Take your time, and open it over the sink.  Don't risk staining a tablecloth.<br /><br />I'm a longtime fan of diet soda, so I would not abandon diet soda for this beverage.  I like carbonation, and this drink has none. The taste resembles Kool Aid and has an unpleasant after taste.",-1,1

B006MONQMC,"Not great but not awful I use Mio water enhancer and that interested me in trying Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. I am trying to drink less soda and thought this might be a fun addition to my day.  It is certainly a better value than Mio.<br /><br />First, it was a pain to open.  It took two of us to peel of the seal under the cap.  I was afraid we were going to spill red juice everywhere.  We finally got it open and added it to the water.  Sure enough, it tastes just like fruit punch.  There is a slight nasty aftertaste.  My palate is not sophisticated enough to tell what it is.  I do drink other diet drinks and found the aftertaste much more pronounced with this one.  As usual, ""energy"" means caffeine and taurine so you'd want to pay attention to that.<br /><br />Overall this might be something I use again.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Delicious and much better value than a $2 bottle of Vitamin Water! 8 ounces of water. 1 squeeze of Vitamin Squeeze. That's pretty much it. That's already easier to do than most powder mixes. I'm not sure how much a ""squeeze"" is exactly, but this stuff shoots out in jet stream so stirring is almost optional.<br /><br />One squeeze gives you 120% of your daily vitamin C; 40% of vitamins B3, B5, B6 and B12; 40mg of caffeine and 10mg of Taurine for energy; and electrolytes to boot. Zero calories, zero sugar, and zero carbs, and all natural flavor. I can't vouch for all the flavors, but the fruit punch flavor is absolutely delicious. I do hope that more flavors become available, though, for even more variety.<br /><br />The best part is the value: There are 24 servings (squeezes) per container. That's 24 glasses. The four packs are selling for just under $24, which means you're paying about $0.25 per serving. That's a heck of a lot cheaper than $2 bottles of Vitamin Water, and no doubt you're getting a healthier drink!<br /><br />The bottles (12 fl oz) are roughly the size of a bottle of sunscreen, which means small enough to toss in a backpack, day bag, or ""bugout"" bag for an infusion of vitamins and small pick-me-up while on the go. The only downside is that it's recommended that you refrigerate it after opening (-1 star). If you've got a cooler, great. Otherwise it might be a challenge to make that happen if you're trekking through the woods or running from a horde of zombies (in which case refrigeration is the least of your concerns anyway).",1,1

Keep it in the fridge for the best taste.  I would recommend this and will buy this again.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes great and a good price I have pretty much kicked my coke/diet coke habit and its thanks to products like this. I wanted to drink more water and less canned soda. I have a hard time getting excited to drink water so I needed something to spice it up. I've tried other products and liked them but not many offer a great taste with low/no calorie, while being enhanced with vitamins.<br /><br />I've tried zipfizz and loved them but at more than a dollar a pop it was getting expensive. I ran across this while looking at the Mio products and thought it was cheaper while also containing vitamins so I'll give it a try first. I have been pleasantly surprised by how good it tastes. It has a little bit of a vitamin'y taste (cant think of a better way to describe it) but not bad at all. You can meter however much you want into your water so your tastes may be different than mine. All in all the taste is very close to Hawaiian Punch. I don't get the same energy buzz I got from ZipFizz but it does give you a small kick to help you out. This costs ~$0.20 a shot for me, I take about 2 full shots in my water bottle and I'm done.<br /><br />I think I've found my new favorite water enhancer and only wish I had the option of ""Subscribe and Save"" so I don't have to worry about running out.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Doesn't Live Up To Claims The directions state 1 squeeze per 8oz of water, so two squeezes for your average bottle of water. The drink label also says 24 servings in the 12oz bottle.

I tried removing the label to check the level of the energy drink, but the bottle is opaque.<br /><br />When a drink uses the word ""energy,"" that is exactly what I expect, but despite all the vitamins I didn't feel any boost...I wouldn' even call it refreshing.<br /><br />I would rather drink plain water.",-1,0

I will not, on principle, eat an eggwhite omelet, and usually consider any salads other than tunafish the stuff you push away from the real food.  But I have a healthy friend, a hiker/jogger type who goes to the gym every morning and can do that dog kick thing that led to my killing an aerobics instructor.  I was acquitted. The jury all had expired gym memberships.<br /><br />Anyway, Healthy Friend came over one morning to make nasty comments about my drinking coffee and huddling on the sofa when I could be exercising and hiking and drinking water out of a bottle.  After lecturing me until I pulled my bathrobe over my head, she left...but she left her bottle of Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink drops behind.  This, by the way, is the new water drinkers trend. Adding flavos and ""energy boosting vitamins."" It turns water into something like diet coke, only with vitamins and without the bubbles and not as good tasting.<br /><br />Now me, I don't want my energy boosted because then I might start doing stuff, and I'm happy sitting right here, thank you.  So I called Healthy Friend and said ""You left those trendy vitamin drops behind,"" and she told me to keep them.  Obviously this was ploy by the incidiously healthy to ensnare yet another unwilling victim into their web. But boy, did they misunderestimate me.<br /><br />I tried the drops. The taste is sweet, kinda like the Kool-Ade I didn't like much when I was a kid. Maybe little tangier, but not much.  I waited for the big energy boost.  Nada.  This will not replace my morning cups of coffee. However, the taste is not bad, the drops are chockful of Vitamics from one end of the alphabet to the other, and for people who do this sort of thing, I'm sure it makes them feel even more smug and complacent.

B006MONQMC,"Big Squeeze Needed How can you have something fruit flavored without calories of any type?  In this drink it is because you have a lot of chemicals and vague ""flavors"" that you can add to water and in one squeeze you'll have the equivalent flavor of  fruit punch in this case.  Except that squeeze needs to be a big one to actually make the water taste like fruit punch instead of just water or water with a chemical edge.<br /><br />Normally I only drink water between meals and at meals either 100% fruit juice or skim milk so I'm not expecting a sugary drink.  However when I tried a small squeeze of this additive it made the water taste horrible, a very strong and difficult to describe chemical taste.  It took me several attempts to find an amount, about 5X the simple squeeze, before the water had a positive fruity flavor.  What this means is that one bottle ends up not flavoring nearly as many drinks as it claims.<br /><br />If you really dislike the flavor of water, something I really can't undertand, and using this will get you to drink more, sure give it a try but just know it is unlikely to last as long as the package claims.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Want to squeeze your vitamins? Now's your chance. I don't drink energy drinks at all. No Monster, no Red Bull, no Bawls, no Monster Bull Bawls...none of that. Usually I stick with water and occasionally go with plain milk, but I requested Vitamin Squeeze Energy just to try it out. And you know what? This stuff isn't bad. I'm a bit confused on how much the serving size is actually supposed to be, since it simply states ""one squeeze"", but it tastes like a watered down fruit punch of sorts, with way more nutrients. That's a big plus, yet the usual artificial sweetener taste bugs me, and the burning question of just what they all really threw into this mixture.<br /><br />Fill a glass with water, squeeze this stuff into it, and you're good to go. No measurement is given- everything you need to know is essentially shown right there on the front of the label. It's nice to see that you get 120% of your daily dose of Vitamin C when using this, but again, it's hard to tell if you're getting more or less than that since everyone's ""squeeze"" is different.<br /><br />If you enjoy energy drinks on a regular basis, I'd recommend this as a somewhat healthier alternative. For some weird reason, I prefer this over good ol' Hawaiian Punch.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"A Product Without a Need After drinking a full 16 oz. bottle of Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch I would much rather wash down a vitamin C tablet and a few ""NoDoze"" with some nice cool clear water. The only reason I can think of to buy something like this would be to provide vitamins and energy in a form that was so pleasing it would encourage you to drink it. This product fails on that account. The flavor is not horrible, but is not something I would seek out. I put the recommended two ""squeezes"" (whatever that is) into a 16 oz bottle of water and started drinking. I kept adding the concentrate a little at a time trying to produce a decent fruit punch taste. Mixed at twice the recommended strength it still tasted weak and vaguely chemical.<br /><br />Again, at twice the proscribed mix, I noticed no ""buzz"" from the caffeine either. With so many similar products out there, it seems to me that a company wanting to compete in this market would concentrate on flavor, aroma and appearance. It takes no skill to put some chemicals in a liquid and bottle it. Turning that liquid into something people might want to consume is another thing. I think Vitamin Squeeze needs to keep working on it.",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"Too sweet, but might come in handy in emergencies I have mixed feelings about this drink concentrate. On one hand, it really is easy to use, and dissolves qquickly in water - without even needing to stir. However, on the other hand, it tastes like children fruit punches - with extra sweetener.<br /><br />It basically is a mix of several vitamins, lots of chemicals, red dye, and artificial sweetener (sucralose/splenda). Half of these things are good for your body, while the rest is not so much.<br /><br />I would keep some in case of emergencies - a quick fix of vitamin C drink when necessary. But, I would not regularly consume it.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Nice taste, lasting energy, but gives me a lasting headache. I like the effects of this drink, however, it gives me a headache that I can't get rid of.  I made it just like the directions said, I even weighed it out in milliliters, and measured one cup of water to it.  At that measurement, it is a little weak, but still good.  It gave me great energy, that lasted for 4 hours or more.  It's not the kind of energy that the energy drinks give me, where I'm all jittery and feel weird.  The second time I mixed it, I used more, about 3 times as much and it made me way to energetic and it felt like I was on speed.  If you are sensitive to caffeine, you need to be careful with this stuff.<br /><br />Pros---<br />Nice taste, tastes just like Hawaiian Punch.<br />Gives lasting energy.<br /><br />Cons---<br />Lid leaks, no matter how hard I screwed it on.  Don't get this on your clothes, or it will never come out.  I got it on my counter and had to use bleach to get it off, even though I wiped it right up.<br />Can be really strong to people who are sensitive to caffeine.<br />Tastes like a child's fruit drink, which some adults may not like.<br />Loaded with artificial ingredients and artificial red dye, but you most likely know that if you read about it.<br /><br />I am giving this 2 stars because of the headache issue.  I would like this stuff, if it didn't give me a headache.

B006MONQMC,"Leaks, Stains and Irritates! Vitamin Squeeze Needs Improvement I was excited to try this because I drink mostly flavored water and I work overnight. I am always in needed of caffeine. I liked the fact that Vitamin Squeeze would help me get in my daily dose of Vitamin's. Unfortunately, Vitamin Squeeze was a huge let down. First of all, it says that you only need one squeeze. I tried what I determined a squeeze to be and my water verily tasted flavored. I added the proper amount (about 5-8 squeezes) to get the coloring of what a fruit punch flavored drink should look like.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze tasted like watered down, but sugary Kool-aid. I actually liked the flavor and continued to drink it. I definitely felt a slight energy increase. It was not enough to make you buzzed, but enough to notice a difference. My biggest problem then came when it was time to take the Vitamin Squeeze home (I first tried it at work). The lid was completely closed and it LEAKED everywhere! On top of that, the red dye in Vitamin Squeeze stained my hand and my desk. I was able to get the stains out, but not happy with the crappy container that this product comes in. I also do not like that fact that IT HAS TO BE REFRIGERATED and you have to shake well before each use. For me, this takes away a lot of the convenience factor. I want something I can take with me places.<br /><br />PROS:<br />*Makes water taste better<br />*You get a larger container for your money<br />*Contains Vitamins and Electrolytes<br />*Sugar, Carb and Calorie free<br /><br />CONS:<br />*You have to add more than you do with similar drinks<br />*It has to be Refrigerated<br />*You have to shake well before using<br />*Has a slight after-taste<br />*You have to limit intake due to Vitamins (too much is bad for you too) and caffeine<br />*The bottle is not secure<br />*It stains<br /><br />Overall, this product has more Cons than Pros. I will not be purchasing any Vitamin Squeeze and I recommend you try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOQKA"">MIO Black Cherry, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> instead.",-1,0

The opening's on the bottom of the container, and it leaks.<br />Secondly, set your beverage in the sink before adding this flavoring to it, especially if you already stored it ""right-side-up"" and it's leaked into the lid.<br />Third, have a paper towel or kitchen rag ready to clean up the bright red drops before they stain anything.<br /><br />That settled, though, the product inside is actually pretty good. It has a decent flavor, no bad sugar-free aftertaste, and no calories. I do like it.<br /><br />Besides, storing it up-side-down in the fridge and knowing to add it to beverages sitting in the sink solve the mess problem, even if they don't keep leaks from wasting the product itself.",0,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamins Please! Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch flavor is delicious. It's in an easy to hold, flexible 12-Ounce container with a flip top. The Fruit Punch flavor is fortified with Vitamin C; 120% of the recommended daily total and taurine which is an essential nutrient said to be necessary for retinal health and found in animal protein. If you're a vegetarian like I am this might be for you! I take it with me to work and add it to my after noon glass of water for a quick pick me up.<br />On the plus side: The color is a vibrant red, there is no nasty after taste. The flavor can be as rich and full as you like, there are no calories, no jittery feeling and no crash. It includes electrolytes which sometimes need replenished due to aggressive work outs or fluid depleting illness. Also the container is double that of the MiO water enhancers.<br />On the down side, it leaves an odd residue on the inside of plastic bottles, so if you are one that likes to reuse them, you won't want to keep the bottle for long. Also because it does that, I'm less inclined to use this product in my stainless steel drinking bottles. If you use it at home, the residue washes off easily with the slightest hand scrubbing. But I noticed it was still present after the dish washing cycle finished. I will say it may have been my dish machine soap not being top grade. If you are all about portability, it's a bulkier package than the MiO.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product due to the convenience of having vitamins on the go, as well as on color and flavor.",1,1

Second, you squeeze one dose into eight ounces of water.  Stir and hold you nose as you drink.  Ok, you don't actually have to hold your nose, but the super sweet flavor will go down a bit easier that way.  Finally, wait for the energy to kick in.  Myself, I tried this four days ago, and I'm still waiting.  Pure gimmick, nothing else.  I'm sure it's all full of vitamins as it says, but it certainly isn't full of energy.<br /><br />On the plus side, it has zero calories, sugar, and carbs, so it won't make you fat as you sit there listlessly.  I also have to say that the squeeze dispenser is pretty cool, and there is no mess afterwards.  Nevertheless, I mixed it into 12 ounces of water, and I could barely swallow the thick, syrupy mixture.  The flavor is overwhelming, and nowhere near pleasant.  Give this one a pass.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"Unnatural & Artificial Back in the day I used to love the single use Crystal Light packets that you would pour into a 16.9 oz water bottle and drink. I also used to drink soda, high fructose corn syrup, and a bunch of terrible-for-you preservatives and artificial flavors. Since then I've come to realize the health risks associated with artificial colors and flavors and added chemicals in our food and drink and try to avoid them when possible. Since these pour in drink flavors have become popular I've been looking for one that was natural and good for you. This one isn't it.<br /><br />First you have Sucralose, (best known for Splenda), which is actually not a zero calorie sweetener (2-4 calories per serving or squeeze in this case, but the FDA doesn't require labeling of calories for less than 5 per serving). But calories isn't the problem with Sucralose, it is the possibility of glycemic load, which it does impact although very little per packet. But if you drink this throughout the day you are messing with your sugar. (See nutritiondata.self. com and look it up). Why not go natural with a Stevia extract? Same sweetness, no glycemic load and not a chemical.<br /><br />Also, Sodium Benzoate is a preservative that when mixed with Ascorbic Acid (which is also in this,) forms Benzene a carcinogen (read: poison.) Google it. The people feeding us this poison say it is in such a small dose that it is safe. Poison... safe?<br /><br />And there are more, but one thing you should definitely know is that the ingredient list here at Amazon doesn't show all the ingredients on the label. Consider artificial color Red 40, which ""According to research conducted by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a possible link exists between food dyes and childhood health disorders such as hyperactivity, behavior problems and even pediatric cancer"" (Live Strong). Also included Gum Acacia, Glyceryl Abietate and Chromium Polynicotinate (which is actually good for you and helps prevent diabetes). Why hide the other ingredients? (Why even have them all?)<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are looking for a natural flavor enhancer to add to water, like I was, then this product will let you down.<br /><br />Oh, and it tastes like Kool-Aid.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"One Way to Get Your Caffeine Water ""enhancers"", or ""energy"" drinks are all the rage now. So this new one by the stand alone company of Vitamin Squeeze, is entering a crowded market. Claiming to be an all natural flavored product, the list of ingredients on the bottle is pretty long (longer than the ingredients listed on both Amazon and the companies webpage). Vitamins A, B3, B5, B6, B12, and C have been ""added"", along with Taurine, Magnesium, electrolytes, and caffeine. Each serving squeeze flavors an 8 oz glass of water, and there are 24 servings in a bottle (or perhaps not - see below).<br /><br />To put this enhancer in perspective, a typical 1oz serving of espresso packs a punch of 40 to 75 mg of caffeine; 40 mg is what this water enhancer provides in an 8 oz glass. The added benefit with the squeeze is that you don't have to add calories via cream and sugar, and you've got a few vitamins thrown in as well. Another plus, is the convenience of simply squeezing in the flavor and caffeine.<br /><br />However, taste wise, the fruit punch tastes like sugar free gum. So yes, it's got that weird phony aftertaste that makes you screw up your face after drinking it. Another problem comes from the squeeze method per serving. One full squeeze delivers much more than is recommended, so each bottle comes no where near 24 servings.<br /><br />All and all, I'm going to stick to coffee and tea for my caffeine, and truly natural juices for my vitamins.",-1,1

B006MONQMC,"Formula and idea is great Taste is OK, but not great. The larger bottle is good as you waste less plastic and need to purchase the product less often. But, it is not as easy to carry with you.<br /><br />This does contain caffeine (which you may well want, but it's important to know). And it also has a nice amount of vitamins.<br /><br />I think I'd prefer a lemon flavor to a fruit punch however.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Flavor was really off-putting... I thought this might be a good way to get the best of both worlds: water plus vitamins. However, the taste was so awful, I couldn't do it. It tasted like bad Kool-Aid. I tried it four times just to see if I could get past the taste for the benefits, but it was a no-go. And on the fourth try, I squeezed the vitamin mix into my water and the vitamin bottle started leaking all over my hand and the counter. I didn't get it all wiped up and it dried super sticky. Makes me wonder just how much sugar was in it! I think I'll go back to the old fashioned way of taking vitamins.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Kool - Aid with a KICK. This is unlike the concentrates that I've ever tried. I like the taste and ease to use. It has concentrated sugar that adds a real nice flavor. As you can tell in the ingredients listed on the product page it has vitamin C listed third, behind water and critic acid. Also a natural form of caffiene, B3 and B6. These provide a pick me up to me after consuming a couple of 8 oz glasses with ice. The bottle is enough to last me about a month, when drinking about 8 oz a day on average. it comes in handy when I run out of soda or don't want a cup of coffee. The amount of natural caffiene is low and does not give me a nervous or jittery type feeling. I use a little less than the suggested amount because of my taste due to the fact that I prefer less sweet drinks.<br /><br />The price is good, and the Subscribe and Save brings it down another 15%. The bottle fits easy into my hand and the cap is sturdy enough to hold upside down and shake without spilling a drop. I would recommend this product as a semi energy drink or a replacement for Kool-aid, as it does have some valuable vitamins.",1,1

I especially liked that the punch doesn't overwhelm with sweetness.  It's a grow-up taste, not a kid one.<br /><br />The vitamins are just an added benefit.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Nice flavor I really like this product. The flavor is good and it does seem to boost my energy level. The only thing I really dislike is the measurement instructions....one squeeze?

It seemed ok, but it would have been good to have a better, more precise method. Still...all in all...I like it!",1,1

She described the taste as ""a pleasant fruity flavor"" but warned to stick with a single squeeze serving - otherwise the flavor became quickly overpowering.

I couldn't prove if they were really in the mix or not or even if I noticed anything related to them.<br /><br />I did notice that it had sucralose and could sure taste it.

B006MONQMC,"Tastes like Crystal Light I used to buy Crystal Light all the time, the kind that had vitamins and stuff in it, and this tastes like the citrus or tropical or something fruit punch flavor which I rather like. I gave up Crystal Light a long time ago in favor of water, I figure who needs to be consuming sucralose, but lately I've been making these concoctions of vitamin C powder and/or MSM powder, the juice of a few limes, some liquid stevia and sometimes an Ester-C packet and I thought I could add this in place of the Ester-C and the stevia and then I'd have a tasty beverage WITH caffeine in it but still with the vitamins.<br />So, I made my concoction this way, and it tasted fine. The one thing I was unsure about was the serving size. The bottle says ""one squeeze"", and I think a squeeze could end up being quite a lot of the bottle if you were quite zealous about it. The side of the bottle says that a serving is 1/2 ounce, which I originally calculated as two tablespoons, but on further reflection I realized my math must be off and it's one tablespoon, but originally I put two tablespoons in 8 oz of water and it tasted about the right strength to me, so that's about how much I was using. I'd think with one tablespoon it would be a bit weak, but this means I only got 12 servings out of my bottle and not 24.<br />Compared to my usual concoction, a glass of this stuff has almost no vitamin C. It does have 120% of the RDA, but compared to what I usually have that is laughably little. It also says it has 40mg of caffeine in a serving, so I tried drinking a bunch of it in an afternoon, but it didn't make me feel a caffeine buzz or anything.<br />Anyway, I've used almost all the bottle and won't be seeking it out when it's gone. The flavor is basically good but I'm not into all that sucralose, artificial color and it kind of rubs me the wrong way that it says ""each squeeze into water adds more flavor and nutrition"".

B006MONQMC,"A good fruit punch alternative The Vitamin Squeeze is a great alternative to buying regular bottles of fruit punch: it's sugar free and concentrated so a small bottle goes a long way. It contains some vitamins, which is probably why the manufacturer feels entitled to pompously claim ""Nutritious"" on the label. I think it's more than a bit of a stretch, but I suppose it's better than guzzling gallons of HFCS-sweetened fruit punch. I would rather see a version free of food coloring and sweetened with Steevia, but this is a step in the right direction.

I was hoping this Vitamin Squeeze fruit punch would be a tasty change of pace, since it also has added vitamins. It's decent, but not as good as I was hoping. I tried it with differing amounts in a few separate bottles of water, and found that in order to taste good I need three small squeezes per bottle. My wife was the same when she tried it, and we both decided that it still tastes vaguely like watered down Hawaiian Punch. Not terrible, but not really tasty and certainly not as good as the Crystal Light packets we use most often, although the trade off with the added vitamins may be worth it.",0,0

Here the flavor is not the best (though it's not as bad as some others I have tasted). I appreciate the vitamins though and if one did not eat well this would certainly help with assuring at least basic amounts of vitamins in the system. I'm not an expert on how our bodies use vitamins or usable sources but in layman's terms it seems all right.<br /><br />I found it tolerable when I could squeeze the right amount but it's a bigger bottle and 1. a little unwieldy to cart around 2. hard to get any real measurement on. It is too easy to put too much or too little. I dislike tinkering - which is why I tend to favor the packets..I know exactly what the product tastes like and how to use it. No muss no fuss. I found at work when I was getting ready to get ice and water I naturally grabbed a packet instead of this.<br /><br />I didn't notice I felt any better (or worse) after drinking it - no better energy or disposition.

I then began using Mio when it came out.<br /><br />""Vitamin Squeeze"" takes the enhancer game a step higher, by adding vitamin C, caffeine, and taurine.  It touts itself as an ""energy drink"", but I honestly didn't feel any bump in energy when I used it.  It has about half the caffeine of a cup of coffee.  The fruit punch flavor is tolerable, but has a ""chemical"" after taste - it's difficult to get artificial fruit flavors right and this could use some work.  The artificial colors and flavors remove it from the ""healthy"" category.  ""Vitamin Squeeze"" also requires refrigeration after it's been opened which is a little inconvenient for me at work, but not necessarily a deal breaker.  The flavor isn't overly intense; one squeeze gives a hint of fruit punch flavor but if you like a stronger flavored beverage, a lot more than one squeeze will be needed.<br /><br />All in all, it's a passable water enhancer, but I wouldn't want to rely on it as a vitamin source or even as an energy drink.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Good alternative energy drink I like that this has sucralose and not nutrasweet in it.  It takes one squeeze to flavor a glass of water.  It has several vitamins, specifically focused on energy - like the B vitamins, and it contains caffiene.  I much prefer this to the little vitamin drinks, and it is a better deal.  I like that it is zero calories.  The taste could be a bit better, but really, no energy drinks are all that good, and I feel better if my teen wanted to drink some of it occasionally than the other brands of canned energy drinks that I see his friends with.  I think it's good that you get the water with it - a lot of times a bit of hydration, aka water, is an energy booster in and of itself, and helps you think better.  It's a generous sized package in a handy size.  There's a lot to like about this, but I'd try some of the other flavors.  This one wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly what I'd call good - it's a long way from a real punch juice drink, but it's drinkable enough to down pretty fast when you need an energy burst.  I wouldn't use it as a regular water enhancer though.  I'd rather just put some mint or juice in my water if I wanted that.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Concentrate in a squeeze bottle This is an energy drink concentrate in a squeeze bottle. Unlike what you might expect the squeezes are not measured, so you can squeeze as much concentrate as you want with each squeeze. The flavor is very mediocre. It was more like cool-aid than a punch flavor with any actual fruit in it. It purports to be good for you (it has vitamins added) but I seriously doubt there is any usable nutrition in this product. It does have caffeine and taurine, so in high enough doses it can be used as a stimulant. While it was drinkable I didn't detect any real thirst quenching capability. In short, it just seems like another product trying to jump on the caffeinated sports drink bandwagon.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"It's decent - okay taste, and some vitamins If you're going to be out-and-about with a bottle of water, this might be a good addition just to give it some variety and taste.<br /><br />I gave this a three-star review when I first tried it. I thought it was okay, but nothing special. It tastes fine. Other reviewers have noticed a bit of an aftertaste, and I agree. I wouldn't say it's unpleasant, but it's present.<br /><br />But, over time I've used the whole bottle, and it's grown on me. It is pretty refreshing, and adds a good boost to a normal glass of water. So I went from ""okay"" to actually liking it. So I boosted it to four stars.<br /><br />The flavor does avoid that chemical taste that some of these enhancers seem to have.<br /><br />The vitamins are a benefit, though I'm never sure if the benefit offsets the chemicals and sucralose ingredients.<br /><br />I noticed no extra 'energy,' but I don't really notice when I drink a soda either. It's just sort of 'there.' Which is better than being jittery, and since this has taurine, like Red Bull, I was wondering about that - did not happen, though, and that's good. Ultimately, 'energy' is subjective and difficult to define from person to person.<br /><br />The drink does at least some of what it says it will do - it gives flavor to water, and apparently does provide vitamins. It tastes pretty good, and adds some life to boring tap water. But, if you're caffeine-sensitive, it's probably best used in morning and early afternoon.<br /><br />As I said, I've updated this as of July 15, from my original three stars to four stars.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Better than Mio There is a lot to like about this drink. The flavor is rich but not too sweet. The size of the bottle is larger than its competitors The drink is touted as an energy drink and has 40mg of caffeine, about the same as an 8 oz can of Coke. The issue with this is that people tend to squirt different amounts in their water so the serving size as well as the caffeine intake is subject to this.<br /><br />The other issue I have with all of these drinks is that you must use the bottle up in a month once it is opened. This drink, unlike Mio, must be refrigerated after opening so you cannot carry it around with you. It is also too large to carry around in a normal sized purse.<br /><br />The drink also claims it has 120 mg of vitamin C in every portion. The daily recommended intake is 70 mg so drinking this should fill one's quota-I would hope.<br /><br />All in all there is a lot to like about this drink and very little to dislike.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamin B does give you energy. This product is not misleading. It always astounds me when reviews for a drink mix complain about artificial flavors and sweeteners. That is pretty much a given.  The product comes from a grocery shelf in a container. Why are there expectations that the product should be the all-natural equivalent of picking a piece of fruit off of a tree? To begin with, the flavor is fruit punch. When has that ever been a natural flavor?  Please.  Those concerned with this issue wouldn't be near any aisle containing this type of product.<br /><br />If you want all natural...drink lemon water.  Flavor and vitamin C without anything artificial.<br /><br />Stepping off the soapbox now.<br /><br />I thought that, compared to other brands of liquid water enhancers, this has been my favorite.  I DID contain vitamins so the labels are not misleading in any ways.<br />The taste was fantastic.  It didn't have a nasty aftertaste. I had no difficulty getting the correct flavor vs water ratio.<br /><br />The only complaint is that one squeeze does not fit all. Depending on your grip, you could be using well more than one serving in your water. While this makes it easy to adjust to individual tastes, it also makes the product wasteful.  I found that my water tasted wonderful with very minimal amounts of product.<br /><br />Final impression: I liked this product. It was nice to have some vitamins with my artificial flavoring and sweetener.  I liked the fruit punch flavor (which is not usually a favorite of mine) and would buy this product in the future.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Blah I had trouble getting the right amount of this mixed in with my water.  It was either too watery or too fruit punchy.  Basically it just seems to me like a lot of other ""water enhancers"" on the market except Vitamin Squeeze has, well, vitamins thrown in to make it ""better for you.""  So far I'm not impressed and downed a good five servings of it without necessarily feeling more energized.  In fact I was more sleepy than normal the first day I tried it and it did little to nothing for me in terms of perking me up.  I think I'll just stick with my regular water since I know that's not loaded with the questionable ""Natural"" flavors as mentioned in the ingredient listing which is beyond suspect.  Skip this one as there's no benefit in my mind.",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"Taste better than Mio I like the fruit punch flavor of this water enhancer. It taste better than the Mio water enhancer's that I have tried. It kind of has a tangy, lemony, punch taste. There is a slight after taste, though.<br /><br />I like that this product adds flavor to water, and has vitamins and caffeine. The part I like best is the caffeine, since I am always looking for a quick pick me up or a morning wake up.<br /><br />I love the idea of water enhancers and I like that they can have additives that we want, such as caffeine and vitamins. What I don't like are all of the chemicals and artificial sweeteners. As long, as you know what you are getting then I guess it is fine.<br /><br />If you want flavored water with a caffeine and vitamin boost, then this is the drink for you.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Good flavor delivers a nice morning jolt. I tried Vitamin Squeeze this morning as an alternative to my usual caffeinated and carbonated morning beverage.  It has a nice fruit punch flavor, and very little after taste.  I followed the directions of one squirt per eight ounces of water, and was rewarded with a light flavor that was not overpowering.  I imagine that you could increase your squirts if you wanted more fruity goodness, but one squirt seemed about right for me.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze was a good eye opener for the morning, and it made me feel good to know I was getting all of those vitamins!  This is a nice product that is easy to use and is one that I will be purchasing in the future.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Cue the cute cheerleaders... Tastes like fruit punch ... the same as most other fruit punches I've had in my lifetime (a little bit of artificial aftertaste, though). You can tailor the taste to your preferences ... although one squeeze per 8 ounces of water is recommended.<br /><br />The big deal is the added vitamin C (with some good amounts of vitamin B also added); I guess good for kids who survive on junk food not fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />Within reason (diarrhea) you can't get too much vitamin c. Also at $6.00 a small bottle is a bit expensive; however this has the usually added stuff like caffeine, taurine, the aforementioned vitamins and also electrolytes ... so in that regard this potion is the equivalent of many super expensive energy drinks. It's up to you to decide what is necessary, if you are trying to have a replacement Crystal Light/Red Bull/Gatorade combo ... go for it - see how it works for you.<br /><br />Keep in mind the bottle has a total of 960 mg of caffeine about 8 cups of normal brewed at home coffee.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Zero calories; zero carbs; zero sugar; zero energy, zero taste.... Everyone has different tastes and likes so for that reason I've rated this 3 out of 5. Personally, the taste is quite yucky.. like a super sweet something or medicine like taste.. Perhaps some people will be ok with that. I wouldnt mind it IF the product gave me some energy as it states. I felt no difference. I use 6 hour energy drinks and  Mio to compare the product too and both those products (although tastes may not be the best) worked very well giving a boost of energy. This bottle is alot bigger too, and only a squeeze is suppose to do the job. Like any product as such I would recommend trying it out once as it may be ok for you or it may not.<br /><br />I personally like the smaller portable bottles. Another thing it needs to be used within 30 days of opening...... something to keep in mind so your forced to use it on a daily basis or it will go bad.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Tastes good, but didn't energize me. Vitamin Squeeze is promoted as an energy drink, but folks, let me tell you, I drink it at 8pm and I'm out like a light by 9pm......and this from a guy who usually sleeps 4-5/night and a cup of coffee keeps me awake for easily 24+ hours! So, minus one star for no energy....I would give it a star for letting me sleep MORE, but that's not how it's advertised. ;-) With that said, I find the taste to be very good. I need to drink a lot for several reasons, and this makesthe water taste much better. I don't really taste a bad after taste, but there is something (I just don't mind it). As for the squeeze being the perfect amount....hmmmm....I don't see how that is as I control the squeeze, and I can squeeze longer or shorter and different amounts come out each time. Either way, it is a good taste and not over the top. I don't need a lot to give my water bottle a better taste. This is 3.5 stars for me, just not enough to bump it to 4....mainly because it doesn't live up to it's energy status and the ""squeeze,"" is in no way accurate. If you are looking for something to flavor your water, this is it....just don't think it will energize you.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Too sweet, medicinal taste. This is a sweet-tasting additive for your bottled water. Just one to two squeezes, depending on the number of ounces of water, and you have added extra vitamins and flavor to plain water.  I felt this was a bit too sweet. It has no added sugar, and zero calories, but does contain an artificial sweetner. It also had a slight medicinal taste. I tried adjusting the amount I put in, but it either tasted like nothing or too sweet.  The directions say the bottle must be refrigerated and used within thirty days. Unless you used this several times per day, I doubt you would use this up in a month. Maybe if more than one uses it?<br />I just think I can get my vitamins from the food I eat and my water from water. I would not buy again.",0,-1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes Good This is not nearly as concentrated as the MIO water flavors that you also squirt into your glass or bottle of water.  But, you get a lot more of it (12 oz) and one 1/2 fluid oz. squirt has 120% daily requirement for vitamin C and no calories.  The fruit punch tastes good, however I like my water to be very weakly flavored so I probably put in about a 1/2 squirt giving me 60% of my daily requirement for vitamin C.<br /><br />It's mainly advertised as being a source of vitamin C, but there are more things beside vitamin C in it:<br /><br />Vitamin C - 120%<br />Vitamin B6 - 40%<br />Vitamin B5 - 40%<br />Vitamin B3 - 40%<br />Vitamin B12 - 40%<br />Zinc - 10%<br />Chromium - 10%<br /><br />The plastic bottle is a good shape for your hand to grab it easily and squeeze.  This might be a good way to get some needed vitamin C without having to eat a lot of citrus or swallowing vitamin C pills.  And, if you like your water flavored but are particular like me, about how much flavor is in it, then this is a good way to control it.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Blech!  Tastes like vitamins I hate plain water. Up until I tried this I'd been using either MIO or Crystal Light to get my daily 6 to 8 glasses. I was hoping this would replace the MIO as it seems to be more cost effective, being a MUCH larger container and about the same amount of squirts per glass. However, I can't get used to the very bitter vitamin-y aftertaste, and the more I think about it, this tastes like watered-down nasty cough medicine.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,Why Bother With This With So Many Energy Drinks on the Market? I don't quite understand the proliferation of these squeeze bottle water additives when there are already so many energy and sports drinks on the market.  Trying to find the right mix that tastes right when you add it to water is not an easy task.  And to me it simply an unnecessary  chore when I can just buy a sports drink I like.<br /><br />This type of product is not for me.,-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"tasty, east to use The only mixes I have added to my water before are powdered and need to be shaken a lot. Not with this one. It is a good sized bottle with a flip cap and a no-drip spout. You just squeeze the liquid into your water bottle and then barely even have to shake it to mix it up. It make take some tasting to decide how much of a squeeze you want to get the right amount of flavor. Also, it says one squeeze per 8ozs of water which is less than your usual water bottle. It has caffeine in it but not a lot, more like soda than coffee. I liked the flavor though I thought it was a bit light so I would add more. As for the energy part, it is hard to tell. I'm tired all the time because of chronic insomnia and other sleep problems. I take Adderall to help with this and it only works a little. So this product didn't stand much of a chance giving me energy. but it might for most others. I liked having vitamin C and B vitamins added to my diet as most vitamin pills upset my stomach, as do high caffeine products. Overall, I think this is a good product and reasonably priced.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Pretty Good Actually I really can't rate the effectiveness of the vitamins, but it does give me a small boost if I add enough to the water.  The biggest draw about is it's convenience and the taste.  It actually tastes pretty good, not overwhelming but just enough.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Not bad This was better than I expected it to be. I was really worried that it was going to have that terrible aftertaste that a lot of drinks without sugar in them tend to have, and while there is a little bit of that aftertaste, it's not that bad and it certainly didn't stop me from drinking this.<br /><br />I like that there are vitamins and electrolytes in this, but I did not notice any ""kick"" from the supposed energy that this is supposed to provide.<br /><br />Someone else mentioned in their review that they added this to crystal light, and I think it would be interesting to try adding this to sprite.",1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes alot like kool-aid! It may do everything the company claims this product will do, but I just couldn't get past the flavor. With ""a few drops"", it tastes like watered down Kool-Aid. If you go ahead and put in more to give it more flavor, it just tastes like really strong kool-aid - cherry flavor, that is. If you like Kool-Aid, maybe this product is right for you. If you are like me and gave up Kool-Aid many years ago, you probably won't like this either.",-1,0
B006MONQMC,"Tasted fine and a good idea but wish it was more natural While this product tasted fine to me and seems like a great idea, looking at the ingredients list, I wish it contained more natural ingredients and less chemicals.

B006MONQMC,"Not Very Flavorful I hate the bland taste of water alone, so I was very excited to receive the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch from Amazon Vine.  After trying the water enhancer, I was left far from satisfied.  Even though this drink packs a large amount of Vitamin C, as well as other nutrients, it is lacking in flavor.<br /><br />I was impressed with the packaging of Vitamin Squeeze.  Unlike some other liquid water enhancers, it comes in an easy to use and mess-free bottle.  Adding the right amount of the drink is simple, and there are no unwanted drops of left over liquid straying behind.  However, for me, this was the best part of the product.<br /><br />I do not like my water enhancers to taste like sugary kid drinks; however, I do like it to do its job and enhance my water with some flavor.  Vitamin Squeeze not only leaves a yucky aftertaste, the flavor itself is almost bitter, while I was expecting a sweeter taste.  In fact, the taste was so weak, I would have preferred to drink the water alone.  I did try this product multiple times, adding more of the drink, yet no matter how little or how much of the liquid I added, there was much left to be desired.<br /><br />I would not purchase Vitamin Squeeze; therefore, I would not recommend it to anyone else.  If you are looking to supplement your daily intake of water and/or Vitamin C, I would stick to a daily vitamin and powered water enhancers.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Good, I'd definitely buy this! I like the flavor of this and it's nice that there are some vitamins in it, too.  This brand is better than the MIO in my opinion, you have to use much less of it to get a good flavor.  My only issue with it is that it says a squeeze will flavor your water perfectly.  Uh, no.  A squeeze of it puts so much of the flavor enhancer into the water that it almost burns my throat.  It's perfect when I actually measured out the ounces, a full ounce for a bottle of 19 oz of water was perfect.  I used the little medicine cups that come with baby medicine to measure it.  LOL",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Artificial aftertaste but otherwise good The taste is pretty good, although there is a bit of an 'artificial' aftertaste that I could live without.

I think the taste is just enough for me but it may be a little too sweet for some.  One quick squeeze gave me all the flavor I needed for a glass of water.  I do think the bottle is a bit leaky when shaken.  It has 40mg of natural caffeine and 10mg of taurine so I will not be adding it to my kid's water as they do not need any ""oomph"".  It did seem to give me a little boost of energy which I need to see my kids off on the bus at 6:30am.  Overall, a viable soda alternative for me and I will be replacing my usual cup of soda with this enhancer.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"I Want Healthy Vitamins, Thanks Make sure you understand the description, and maybe you won't be disappointed.  This is a caffeinated energy drink.  There are vitamins added to it (nice touch, but having Sucralose for the sweetener along with as much caffeine per serving as a can of soda kind of kills the health aspect of it).<br /><br />The taste was pretty good if you don't mind the artificial sweetener aftertaste, and my disappointment was really caused by this combined with the caffeine.  I was hoping for something yummy to add to my water to help me stop drinking soda.  It doesn't exactly help a caffeine addiction to keep drinking caffeine.  When I read the description, I thought that the energy function of this was supposed to be vitamins...not caffeine.<br /><br />I gave low stars because this was misleading to me and NOT what I wanted.  Just know what you're getting and if it's what you want, this isn't so bad.  Still better for you than the other energy drinks or soda, just don't expect something healthy.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Slightly medicinal, with a lingering aftertaste. About this product, it must be said: I didn't have very high hopes. I'm not into the whole ""flavored water"" thing (my choice of flavored water being Diet Coke), and I think the energy beverage craze is a joke (you want high energy levels? GET MORE SLEEP!), and so ultimately this product, at least for me, comes down to one thing: taste.<br /><br />In that area it's merely ok. It tastes kind of like Kool Aid fruit punch, only not quite as good. It also has a vaguely medicinal taste about it, and as I mentioned in the headline, a lingering aftertaste. Whether that taste is good not depends on how much you like the flavor. As it is, I'm wishing I had some Diet Coke around.<br /><br />This isn't by any means a bad product, but I'm fairly sure that you could get the same effect with sugar-free Kool Aid or the like, and probably spend a lot less money. Or, alternatively, get a good night's sleep, drink plain water and eat an orange. You'll have pretty much the same outcome.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"If you're a fan of sugar-free fruit punch, you could do worse. I'm a fan of MiO ""water enhancer"" so when I saw the possibility of a MiO replacement that's been vitamin-enriched, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Like MiO fruit punch flavor, Vitamin Squeeze (henceforth, ""VS"") is a ""zero nutrition"" product - no calories, fat, sodium, carbs, sugar or protein. Unlike MiO, there are additions of vitamins and minerals including vitamins B3, B5, B6, B12, and C, chromium, magnesium and zinc. It also contains 40mg ""natural caffeine"" per serving which is slightly more than a can of Coke or Pepsi. In comparison, MiO is caffeine-free.<br /><br />I can't honestly say that I had any reaction to this as an ""energy drink"" a la Red Bull or 5-Hour Energy. The caffeine content gave me a similar high as a caffeinated soft drink but nothing more exceptional than that.<br /><br />Both VS and MiO offer 24 servings per container but while MiO manages to pack this into a refrigeration-free container of less than two ounces, the VS product requires refrigeration after opening and comes in a 12 ounce bottle. I assume the additional mass is the result of the vitamin and mineral supplements that are part of the VS offering. There's an obvious mixed trade-off here; on the one hand you'd get the benefit of the supplements, on the other hand it's a larger bottle that requires refrigeration.<br /><br />But the question remains: How does it taste? I find that it tastes exactly like every other sugar-free fruit punch product I've ever tried. In a blind taste test I was unable to distinguish between VS, MiO, Crystal Light, ""Great Value"" (Walmart's house brand), or Wyler's Light fruit punches. Whether you like those or not, the VS product will virtually match those expectations.<br /><br />There is one other thing that I found odd with this product and that has to do with its packaging. Inexplicably, the VS bottle expects to be stored upside-down. I could understand this if the VS product were syrupy but it's not. So you store it upside-down, then turn it rightside-up to uncap, then upside-down again to use, then rightside-up again to recap, then upside-down again to store. Very weird.<br /><br />Therefore, this gets four stars. On the pros list I include the vitamin and mineral content and a ""not bad"" taste. Cons include mandatory refrigeration, larger bottle size, and (on a much smaller note) a very weird bottle configuration.",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Packs a Punch I have a need for higher levels of Vitamin C.  Sometimes, I find a desire to have it in something other than the standard tablets.  Although the flavor of Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is strong, it did leave a slight aftertaste.  It is hard for me to judge the actual potency, put it seemed just as good as any other generic pill, but more flavorful.  The downside for me was that it stained my finger and the two drops that got on the countertop also stained it.  That would not deter me from using it again in the future.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Great Tasting I love this drink. Squeeze a bit into water, lemonade , or club soda. This tastes great.

""A squeeze"" could mean a split second or several seconds. I'm still not sure, to be honest, exactly how much of the stuff I was suppose to put in a glass.<br /><br />I actually kind of liked the taste. I HATE the taste of fake sugar. It always leaves an aftertaste that I can't take. I had to put a good bit of this stuff in a glass of water to make it slightly bad tasting. It's not overly sweet, which I appreciate. I think others might not like that, though. I prefer my flavorings to be very mild tasting. Others might prefer really sweet, which would not be this one.<br /><br />Overall, if you like mild flavors, give this one a try if you're willing to experiment a bit with now much to put in a glass.

B006MONQMC,"Terrible after-taste I was excited to try this, particularly now that summer is here. I am not a big fan of plain water, and it's portability would make it nice for taking to playdates, picnics, etc. So as soon as I got the bottle, I tried it out. I was terribly disappointed.<br /><br />There are a couple of issues I have with this. The first is that the bottle just instructs you to squeeze - no amount is listed, and you can squeeze a crazy amount at one time. I realize this is so people can make it to their own taste, but a baseline would be nice.<br /><br />By far the worst part of this energy drink is the after-taste. I couldn't even finish my glass the two times I tried it. I figured maybe I just needed to adjust the flavor after the first time, so I waited a few days and then used less in the cup. The initial flavor wasn't bad (watered-down fruit punch, basically), but the after-taste was nasty. I can't even bring myself to drink any more.<br /><br />I think I will be sticking with other tried-and-true water additives.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes Weird, but Not in a Good Way When I smelled the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, I really couldn't wait to try it - it smells like Hawaiian Punch!  Anything that smells like Hawaiian Punch can't taste bad, right?  I squeezed it into a glass of cold water - still smells faintly of Hawaiian Punch...should be good.  Then I tasted it...not even close to tasting yummy.  In fact, it has this weird ""not quite sugar, but trying to pretend to be sugar"" weird salty vitamin aftertaste taste.  In short, if you open a bottle of Centrum vitamin pills and sniff it, that's what it tastes like - just slightly fruit punch flavored.  It just doesn't taste good.<br /><br />I tried giving Vitamin Squeeze Energy drink a fair shot...I mixed it with ice water.  I added more for more fruit flavor.  I added less to see if I could tolerate it in small doses.  The results were all the same...the taste is just yuck.

B006MONQMC,Nasty Bitter Medicine Flavor. I have tried many water flavorings and additives. So far none are worth it. This one actually smells really good. Like a srong cup of cherry koolaid. So I was hoping for the flavor as well. No such luck. One squeeze to 8oz just tasted like it poisoned my water. 2 squeezes darkened the color and made the aftertaste worse. 3 squeezes gave a light fruity hint of  flavor but the bitterness and aftertaste overwhelmed it. Since it tastes like cough syrup I did not try 4 squeezes. I might mention the aftertaste is like diet dinks with artificial sugar that makes the roof of your mouth feel caked up. So I did drink tons of good old fashioned plain water to get rid of it. So it really does make you drink more water but not for the reasons it claims.,-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"peps up water with caffiene, vitamins, and electrolytes Okay, so this must be a sort of hybrid Gatorade/Monster/Sunny Delight offspring.  It contains lots of Vitamin C, other vitamins, 40 mg of natural caffiene, taurine (10 mg), and electorlytes, and you mix it all into a glass of water.  Convenient, very.  I hated it but my teenage son loves it.  It tastes like Kool-Aid to me, but he likes it when he goes on a walk, mixed in his water.  One bottle has 24 servings to mix in (goodness, what would happen if you didn't read the instructions...yikes!), so this little bottle could conceivably last awhile.  And, it's better than buying 24 separate bottles of vitamin water (too much plastic!).<br /><br />So I'm rating it good for convenience and the idea itself, but a better flavor would be nice.  At least it's not gritty like some water supplements...because this is liquid, it blends very well.  Wait.  Okay, bumping it up to a four star.  This is pretty handy!",1,0
B006MONQMC,"Cloying Sweetness I received one bottle of this swill and am thankful that I did not receive the 4 bottles that are advertized. I squeezed up a glass of this horrible product per the instructions. I took the glass into the living room where my wife was working a crossword puzzle. She watched me with amusement because she said after each sip I would make a face that looked like Quasimoto was in the house. I continued to sip despite the horrible sweetness in a effort to obtain the alleged energy. Never happened. The only thing I obtained was a major revulsion and a puzzlement as to why anyone would purchase this terrible and useless drink.

B006MONQMC,"Tastes okay, but too weak, and bottle LEAKS! First of all, this thing is packaged like Fort Knox.  It has an outer plastic sleeve that you have to cut through and remove, and then (an important point that you might not realize until you've been squeezing and squeezing unsuccessfully) you have to remove the cap and cut off a membrane covering the mouth of the bottle (it has a pull tab, that that was unhelpful; I had to use a knife).  That right there should remind you to treat this stuff like medication; don't leave it where children can get a hold of it!<br /><br />The item description says, ""Specially designed cap delivers the right amount in one squueze with no drips or mess,"" so I figured you squeeze until it stops.  Fortunately, I added the Vitamin Squeeze before the water, so I could see that it had squirted out a LOT.  A serving size is supposed to be 15ml, which is about three teaspoons (one tablespoon).  But it had squirted out about a quarter cup!  Okay, maybe the cap isn't so ""specially designed"" after all.  I opened the cap to pour it all back in, but the liquid had leaked down around the threads of the cap, and proceeded to drip down on my hand and the kitchen counter.  And let me tell you, this stuff stains!<br /><br />I wiped off the bottle, rinsed out the cap, replaced it, then measured out three teaspoons into 8 ounces of water.  It tasted very weak, so I kept adding more until it tasted okay.  Flavoring 24 ounces of water took half a cup! This tasted okay, but then I realized three shocking points:<br /><br />(1) The beverage I just created contained 320mg caffeine!<br />(2) It had used a third of the product to produce one bottle of beverage!<br />(3) This put my 24-ounce drink at a cost of $2!<br /><br />So, while Vitamin Squeeze doesn't taste too bad (think: fruit punch with a chewable vitamin tablet dissolved in it), and I'm all for slipping in a little caffeine, this product has too many drawbacks:<br /><br />*It's too hard to open.<br />*It uses too much dye.<br />*The bottle itself is poorly designed.<br />*The concentrate does not have enough flavor per recommended serving (and, thus, to reach an acceptable flavor, you get far too much caffeine).<br />*The cost per serving is way too high.<br /><br />I won't be buying this again.<br /><br />UPDATE 3-30-12: I went to make myself a drink with this today, and when I picked up the bottle to shake it, it went everywhere!  My kitchen looks like a crime scene!  My hands are stained, the floor is stained, the rug is stained.  I know the lid was on tight, and I washed off the bottle yesterday, so this was definitely fresh leakage (it leaks into the cap when stored, as designed, on the cap, and then when the bottle is turned over, it pours out from under the cap).  I know other reviewers have noted that the lid leaks, but I had no idea how bad.  This is a SERIOUS issue.<br /><br />UPDATE 5-15-12: I wrote to the company to ask about my concerns, and no one ever got back to me.  I'm VERY wary of a company selling a ""health"" product that has non-existent customer service.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Not Too Shabby I've tried a number of different powder and liquid water flavorings and this one is definitely above average when it comes to flavor, non-chemical taste and smell. There's a very faint acidic aftertaste, but nothing that will turn you off from drinking it.

It is sweetened with the artificial sweetener sucralose which turned me off immediately since I generally avoid all artificial sweeteners. (I think they're yucky chemicals I don't want in my body or my kids' either). But I decided to try it anyway. Before I could do so, my 10 year old asked if he could try it, and his verdict was, ""It tastes like drinking a glass of liquid benadryl.""

This bottle reminds me of the kind of catsup that stands on its top.<br /><br />So, I take the plastic off of the top, and try to take off the inner seal, but it did not remove the way they showed it should come off, so I had to take a knife and go around the bottle opening to take it off.<br /><br />Then things really went downhill from there!!<br /><br />So, I put the top back on and shake the bottle as directed.  I opened my water bottle. It doesn't say you cannot do this, in fact on the bottle itself it does show 2 kinds of water bottles, both with their tops off.<br /><br />Then the liquid squirts out of the bottle, onto my counter, which by the way you will need Soft Scrub or some kind of cleanser to get the liquid off of your counter, because it will NOT just wash off with a sponge, because I tried that first.  It did NOT work! The stain was still there, before I used the Soft Scrub to remove the stain.  Good thing it did work, because Iam a renter, and it left a huge stain!  Why this enery drink would even leave a stain that cannot just be wiped up with wet sponge is a mystery to me, which also makes me question what could be in this drink to make it even do that? That's the big question!<br /><br />The liquid squirted out onto this dish that I keep on my counter which I use for fruit, bread, etc.  Needless to say, the liquid was on the dish, and got into the bread/plastic, so I had to throw that away too.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor.  It's terrible!  It tastes fake,artifical,leaves a weird taste in your mouth, kind of like Hawaiian Punch, but worse!  Good thing I did not use alot of it in my water bottle!  I couldn't even get through the whole bottle, in fact after only a few sips I was done wanting to even drink this drink!<br /><br />I don't know if this company makes other flavors as well, but I won't even be using this bottle, it will be thrown in the trash, where it belongs, at least to me.<br /><br />I thought this would be like Mio, but no, not in any way!!<br /><br />I rarely say the word ""hate"" period.<br /><br />I have been a member of the Vine Program for several years, and in that time I don't think I have ever said that word as a Vine member, nor in any review that I have given on Amazon, and I have been a customer on Amazon's site since 1998, that is how much I hate this product!!<br /><br />I can't think of one good thing to say about this product, sadly!<br /><br />I would give it a minus one if I could!!",-1,-1

B006MONQMC,"Needless entry to a crowded market With the rush of `flavored water' drinks on the market I decided to give ""Vitamin Squeeze"" a try. I will admit to a level of apprehension but thought it could be really good. There are a lot of them.<br /><br /> Opening the cylinder the concentrate was a light red color that looked like Hawaiian Punch and had a faint scent like Kool Aid. OK I thought, so far so good. I poured out a small glass of water. Following the directions added a squeeze of the syrup.<br /><br />It had the color of Hawaiian Punch  but was cloudy, still had the same scent. So far so good. Then I tasted it. there was a faint fruity taste but also a chemically taste that was less pleasant. ""Maybe I didn't use enough."" I added another squirt hoping it would increase the flavor. It did. Unfortunately the wrong flavor. The fruit flavor had faded entirely, overwhelmed by the chemical flavor. In short, bleah!<br /><br />The label says ""Nutritious & Delicious.""

It does have a fairly high caffeine content so I assume that is where the energy is supposed to come from.

B006MONQMC,"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink - Good Ingredients, Short Shelf Life, Poor Packaging <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQMC"">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> is a good product that is a nice alternative to taking multi-vitamin tablets or drinking Vitamin Water and the like.  For those that believe in taking multi-vitamins, one serving a day is about the equivalent of one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins.  The serving size of ½ floor ounce per 8 ounces of water is about a teaspoon.  The taste was stronger than I was expecting, and the fruit punch flavor tasted more like a tart pink-lemonade to me.  This is similar to Crystal Light, but I found this product to have less of an artificial sweetener aftertaste.  Your mileage may vary as taste is entirely subjective.<br /><br />PROS<br />++ Large bottle brings down the per serving cost of the product<br />++ One serving equal to one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins<br />++ Less artificial sweetener aftertaste than Crystal Light or Mio, at least for me<br />++ Added caffeine and Taurine may give some people an energy boost<br />++ More economical than competing drinks like Mio and Vitamin Water<br /><br />CONS<br />-- Recommended shelf life is only 30 days<br />-- No clear area to see how much is left in the bottle<br />-- Bottle cap made of fragile cheap plastic and could be prone to leaking<br />-- Bottle is too large and requires refrigeration, so it's not ideal for travel<br />-- Still ridiculously expensive when compared to generic multi-vitamin tablets<br /><br />WARNINGS<br />++ Refrigeration recommended after opening<br />++ Not for children!  It says so right on the bottle<br />++ Some are more sensitive to the taste of artificial sweeteners than others, so try a sample first<br />++ Multivitamins are not for everybody, so consult your physician if necessary<br />++ Too much vitamin intake can be bad, so portion control is necessary<br />++ Contains Taurine which is animal derived<br /><br />The product is not vegan friendly, because it contains Taurine which is animal derived.  Will the added caffeine and Taurine provide an energy boost beyond the product's nutritional content?  Your mileage may vary here as well.  I suspect this will not have a noticeable benefit to those who are used to consuming 40 ounces of coffee per day.  But it may replace the caffeine craving that many people satisfy with sugary sodas.<br /><br />The packaging is large, designed to make 24 portions.  It is re-sealable, and they recommend you refrigerate after opening.  But the cap seems like it is very breakable, particularly for a bottle designed to be stored cap-side down.  The signage is on a plastic label that surrounds the bottle, but there is no clear area to see how much product is left in the bottle.  Even with refrigeration, the recommended shelf life is only 30 days.  So this product will work best for those who have at least one serving daily.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This is a good product that provides another alternative for those looking for vitamins or a caffeine boost.  The shelf life is not very long.  And the packaging could use some improvement.  But the product itself is better tasting than I expected, and it will definitely appeal to some people.<br /><br />Enjoy.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Surprisingly Pleasant For flavor, I felt like this was a big step up from the similar product <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY"">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> that I've reviewed in the past. That one had a pretty strong artificial sweetener overtone to it, while this is much milder. It's sort of vaguely fruity tasting without being identifiable as any particular fruit in the way things referred to as 'fruit punch' tend to be.<br /><br />It's not exactly super health food, but if you prefer your water a little flavored and you'd like some caffeine and a few vitamins in it, it tastes nice enough to be a good choice. Obviously, on the other hand, if you really don't want caffeine and can't stand the idea of consuming artificial flavoring and that kind of stuff, go elsewhere. (I'm sort of confused by the people who've reviewed it and say they don't like it because it contains caffeine. It's not like the caffeine is a surprise someone sprung on them. They talk about it right on the front of the bottle...)<br /><br />For the size and the fact that it needs to be refrigerated after being opened, this isn't going to compete with a product like Mio, though, for being something you can keep in a bag and take with you everywhere to use during the day. I also felt like the cap felt sort of flimsy and like it didn't want to go back on right. It might just be my perception, but it seemed like it might be easy to break it off.<br /><br />On the whole, vitamins and nutrients are still best gotten from whole foods. On the other hand, if you want some vaguely fruity flavored water that happens to have caffeine and a few built in supplements, it's worth a shot. It might not hurt to find somewhere you can buy 1 bottle first to try instead of the 4 they have here, so you'll have less to figure out how to get rid of if it happens not to suit your tastes, though.",1,1

B006MONQMC,"Fair- not super... ...but I guess it does the trick. I have a VERY high tolerance for energy drinks, so it's obviously difficult for me to evaluate the energizing properties of them. Fortunately, I was able to share this with some of my friends, and we discussed the strong and weak points of the product as we finished off the entire bottle (haha).<br /><br />My buddies assured me that the energy-boosting performance of Vitamin Squeeze was comparable to some of the other energy additives on the market, like Mio; probably a notch below something like a Monster or a large Red Bull, but comparable to a Coke. The big selling point here is the fact that Vitamin Squeeze claims to derive its energy properties from its vitamin C content and its natural caffeine.<br /><br />As regards the taste, it's okay... it's pretty much what one would expect: tasty, but obviously not as gustatorally satisfying as the aforementioned Coke, or anything sweetened with sugar/corn syrup. The trade-off is the better healthfulness and the vitamin/mineral gains. It doesn't taste BAD- kind of like Kool-Aid, but not quite as 'sugary.' On some level, we just have to accept that a healthy product is going to be different from what we're trying to replace in our diets.<br /><br />Overall, though, it's probably the best water-enhancer I've tried (I've sampled a few others, including several flavors of Mio), and if my friends' testimonies are accurate, it also supplies a decent amount of energy. For someone looking for a decently healthful energy-boosting water enhancement, it's worth a try.",0,1

One bottle lasts a long time since it makes 24 servings.<br /><br />Cons: The packaging could be better. It's hard to get it to squeeze properly - either nothing comes out, or you get a gush all at once. Although the bottle is designed to be stood cap-down, it leaks a small amount when positioned in that manner. It needs to be refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />Taste: It's just OK.

B006MONQMC,"Just a mess all the way around. I love energy drinks. This one is kind of a mess in every way. First, it leaks,or at least mine did. It leaked when I 'squirted' it into the glass (from the cap itself, not the intended spount within the cap) and it stained my towel I used to clean it up with. Then it leaked when I turned it upright, so I tried storing it in the fridge and it leaked either way. Blah! It could have been just this bottle, but I only have this bottle to review :)<br /><br />Typically, most 'one squirt is enough to make 8 oz' bottles tend to give the same amount at every 'one squirt'. Well, this one is very much like a bottle of dish soap, one squirt could really go on a long time and you could squeeze the bottle while squirting and practically empty it. In short, I don't think the measurement part is any good at all.<br /><br />The flavor is just okay. I would compare it with most name brand fruity kids' drinks, with a hint of chemical flavoring. Yum, right? Not really. As I mentioned, I really enjoy energy drinks with Taurine etc and this was nothing like them, much more like fruit juices that don't contain actual juice.<br /><br />Lastly, I tried this on my day off. I made my drink kind of strong because I tasted it as I went and wanted it to be less watery flavored. An hour later, I took a nap. No problem.

Too much guess work and not enough consistency for me.<br /><br />The taste was OK. If you hate to drink plain water it won't win you over. It tasted like cheap, party punch bowl punch.

B006MONQMC,"More Like Vitamin Squeeze Enemy I had read a few of the reviews on Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch flavored water enhancer before I first tried it.  I noticed a couple said it was on the sweet side.  My experience seems different than most of the reviewers, so I am not sure if I got a ""bad bottle"" or what<br />One serving is ½ ounce squeezed into 8 ounces of water.  The bottle is 12 ounces so you should get about 24 servings.<br /><br />Ingredient-wise, one serving of the  Fruit Punch flavor (1/2 ounce) has some vitamins in it, primarily Vitamin C (120% of the RDA), followed by 40% RDA of B3, B5, B6, and B12.  It also advertised 10% RDA of Chromium and Zinc., but it's also got 40mg of caffeine serving, so less than a Red Bull but more than some other drinks, including some sodas.<br /><br />I've tried this product with a good squeeze into an 8 ounce glass of water and more than one squeeze in a larger glass (about 12 ounces).  It tastes weak to me. .  I have used ""water enhancers"" before, usually with good results in both use and flavor.  I also think I've mastered squeezing things from a bottle, so I'm assuming I was ""operating"" it correctly!  I do not like things overly sweet, so I don't think its my taste being off.<br /><br />I've tried it a few times, shaking the bottle before squeezing, trying ""a little more"", a little less water......it's very weak, sort of like if you took a few teaspoons of a fruit juice and mixed it in water.  I found the only way it offers any taste of any sort is to use a very loooong squeeze of it into an 8 ounce glass of water.  I can only describe it as tasting like a severely watered down Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.<br /><br />I actually tried putting it into the glass before the water, just to see how much I was using in order to get some taste.  I found I was using far more than the  ½ ounce.<br /><br />I also ran into an issue with the bottle itself.  The drink was leaking from where the bottle meets the screw on cap.  I checked it several times to ensure it was screwed on properly.  There is what appears to be a (cardboard? foam?)  ""washer"" in the cap.  I made sure it was seated, to no avail.  Removing it didn't help either.<br /><br />The leak presented a major drawback as it time I used the bottle I ended up with red dye on my hand, and/or counter, floor, in the fridge, etc.  I ended up having to discard it before it was empty due to the mess it was making.<br /><br />So, again, I am not sure if I got a bad bottle, but I hope I did, because otherwise this stuff is awful.  I do want to note again that many of the product's reviews are good, so my experience may be isolated, but going by the bottle I used, I'd steer clear of this product.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink I was looking forward to a water additive that actually provided energy too.  It's an internal struggle to avoid soda but I can't seem to give up caffeine in the mornings.  So enter vitamin squeeze, something that claims to give me energy and still be somewhat healthy, all making me drink water at the same time.<br /><br />I have to say, I didn't really get any energy kick from this drink.  It was like drinking regular water in that regard.  Sure there are some vitamins in there.  I was pleased to see that there was a lot of Vitamin C and Vitamin B's in there.  I don't really eat a lot of foods that contain those so it was a nice supplement.  And it was still 0 calories so you weren't adding much there either.  The rest of the ingredients I wasn't as fond of though.  The sweetener in this is Sucralose, and while I know there's a lot of controversy about the fake sugars, I'm just not a fan, and tend to avoid it when possible.  It has a strange aftertaste to me as well.  A lot of the other ingredients were the hard to pronounce type as well, and even though some of it was the vitamins, I like to see natural stuff in what I'm drinking.<br /><br />The taste was ok.  Kind of like watered down kool-aid, which I haven't had in forever.  So it made me feel a little like a kid again.  You're supposed to use one good squeeze per 8 oz of water.  But I find myself using twice that as I like a stronger flavor.  And as said before, it still tasted a little weak, although it did give the water a nice red color pretty quickly.<br /><br />One side note on the packaging.  It's easy to squeeze but I've been having trouble with it leaking around the cap.  I've tried tightening it to no avail, so I have to keep this drink packaging upside down.  Not a big deal at all, but if you don't and it does leak, it will stain any light surfaces around it.<br /><br />I wouldn't probably buy this again as I don't like the ingredients, but for someone who's not as concerned about such things, this may be a good drink additive.<br /><br />Review by M.

B006MONQMC,"Cough syrupy, metallic taste :( Since I can never remember to take a daily multi-vitamin, I thought this would be a great alternative.  Multi-vitamins generally do not have a taste to them and this product definitely has a taste and for me, not a good one. I tried 1 squirt and I tried 2 squirts to make it more palatable, but nothing worked. I still got the cough syrup taste with the metallic bite. Ugh. I always drink bottled water, but I could not drink a bottle with this product in it.  Just could not.<br /><br />I also am not a fan of Splenda and I won't even put red dye in the sugar water I make for the hummingbird feeder so I am not about to choose to ingest a product that contains Red 40.<br /><br />For some this product might work - for me it did not!",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"Not bad at all for a fruit punch I have become fond of squeeze-in flavors for my cold water on the rocks (I like it cold, cold, cold), and though you have to keep this one in the refrigerator after opening, it's more coldness, so it's not bad. I'm over there getting my tray of ice cubes, anyway. I do feel that an extra soupcon of vitamins helps me out, and since I control the squeezing, I can make the drink as fruity and sweet as I like, or not. Fruit punch is not usually my favorite flavor, but this is pretty good, and of course, I can mix it. My boyfriend adds rum ;-)",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Artificial taste, typical stimulent based energy drink This bottle of fruit punch flavored Vitamin Squeeze sat in my refrigerator for a while.  I usually drink filtered water and I don't typically like to add anything to it.  But the Vitamin Squeeze product seemed like a good thing to try, not only for the flavor it adds to water but for the small array of vitamins this product adds.<br /><br />When I finally got around to trying it, I wanted to judge it based on flavor and health benefits based on the ingredient list.  For flavor, I did not really care for this product.  The sucralose gives it that unmistakable artificial taste, and the first word that popped in my head when I tasted it was ""fake.""  It tastes cloyingly sweet and artificial, like those bottles of ""healthy"" fruit punch you see in the juice aisle.<br /><br />For the health benefits, I am always somewhat skeptical of any product that claims to increase ""energy"" yet contains no carbs or calories.  And like most ""energy"" drinks, one of the ingredients is ""natural caffeine"" mixed with an assortment of B-vitamins and an amino acid.  In my opinion, this product might increase your energy levels temporarily, but much of that effect comes from the stimulant properties of caffeine.<br /><br />The real test of a product like this is ""would I drink it again.""  And the answer for me is ""No.""  I found the taste very artificial and I don't like using sucralose-containing (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ"">Splenda</a>) products.  (I switched to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8Y892"">Truvia Natural Sweetener</a> a long time ago).  I am also sensitive to caffeine, and drinking any caffeine containing product after a certain time leaves me with insomnia.  Personally, I would prefer skipping this product and continuing to drink plain water, taking a vitamin supplement for the extra vitamins.  So overall, I do not recommend this product.  The only reason I upgraded from 1 star to 2 stars is the fact that this product does contain some beneficial vitamins, unlike most ready-made, highly sweetened fruit punch drinks.",-1,1
B006MONQMC,"Can't be good for you This stuff tasted like cough syrup, but actually tasted kind-of good if you don't use too much. Yet, to get the vitamin benefit, you have to use quite a bit and it really is like cough syrup and way to sweet for my liking.<br /><br />A light squeeze only give you 10-25% of your daily B vitamin and a double-portion (yuck) will give you your daily. That SUCRALOSE stuff is used in all the ""vitamin"" drinks now, but really...it's not good for you.<br /><br />Your better off pop-in a high-dosage multi-vitamin and drink plain water...",-1,1

B006MONQMC,"About that taste . . . Short version:  It's tastes weird<br /><br />Longer version: My first impression of this stuff was negative. They make a big deal about it making no mess, but when I first opened it it squirted little drops on my counter, leaving read stains that took some effort to clean. Do not get this stuff on your clothes.<br /><br />Next came the taste. It's not so much fruit punch as punch in the tongue. It's somewhere between ok and nasty. Yes, it has vitamins in it, so you can't compare it to normal fruit punch, but still. Yuck.<br /><br />So if you absolutely need some sort of vitamin drink in your life, I'm sure this isn't the worst one out there. But I will not be drinking it in the future.",0,0

B006MONQMC,"Easy to Use, but Nasty Aftertaste I received the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink in Fruit Punch through Amazon Vine. Thankfully, I didn't pay for it. My first bad experience with the ""Lift n' Pull"" safety tab that wouldn't budge. After taking scissors to it, I finally got it open without making too much of a mess. There doesn't seem to be any harmful ingredients, and no calories, carbs, sodium, etc. But there is ""natural caffeine"" and vitamins. With so many chemical ingredients listed, I doubt the ""natural"" part of it. With a short squeeze it only diluted the water and barely had a taste, so I sqeezed a bit more in. It tastes a bit like a citrusy-fruit punch. Not too bad. But then the after taste hit me, and I can't get the nasty sickly-sweet taste out of my mouth. I think I'll stick with the sugar-free drink mixes from Crystal Light. They taste better. And I'd rather stay away from the caffeine.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,Easy Vitamin Boost No sugar and no carbs.  It is easy to add to my water bottle when I work out and to iced tea for a boost of flavor and vitamins.  The flavor is good and is sweet despite the claim of no sugar.  I will buy it again.,1,1

It reminds me of the 4 or 5 blade razors that are prevalent today- do we really need such technology? Probably not, but if it helps you get your vitamins, I suppose it's not a bad thing. Aside from the package design, the drink is fine and the concept of adding this to your other drinks is great. I never even thought to do this with my powder vitamin packages. The squeeze makes accurate portioning difficult, but all in all, this is a worthwhile buy.",1,-1

B006MONQMC,"Helps me get in my water ""quota"" I am not a fan of drinking water, however because of dehydration issues, my doctor is always on me about drinking more.  I have tried lots of other water ""additives"" from mio drops to crystal light powders, and everything in between.  I have not had much luck with many other flavorings, because I do not like the chemical after-tastes that many of them have.  With that said, I was pleasantly surprised by these vitamin squeeze drops.  First, the bottle is huge, it is so much larger than the mio (and similar products) bottles that are also available.  I was pleased to see that there was no caffeine or sugar in it, and it also has lots of vitamins.  Most pleasing was the fact that when I drank water with it, there was no nasty after-taste.  As for it being an ""energy"" drink, I did not notice any marked increase in my energy, but that was not an issue for me since that wasn't what I was looking for. However, since I did not notice an increase in my energy, I was not able to give this item 5 stars.  On the other hand, it has really helped me to increase my water intake, which makes me, my kidneys, and my doctor very happy.  I will continue to purchase and use this product.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Extra Energy? Where? As a new mom, I could use some extra energy and when I saw this, I thought it would be perfect for me. One of the pros is that it has lots of B vitamins in it with no sugar, carbs, or calories so you can use it even when dieting and it's not unhealthy for you like all those sugared up energy drinks like Red Bull. I also liked that it added flavor to a bland glass of water, but the flavor was not quite fruit punch, but more like a bitter cough drop, so it wasn't tasty to me. I couldn't get past the after taste either. Aside from bad flavoring I liked the easy squeeze container so there's no measuring/mixing like with powdered style flavorings - I could squeeze it right into a bottle of water and use as much or as little as I wanted.<br /><br />What I didn't like about it besides the taste, is that it DOES NOT give you extra energy. I felt no bursts of energy or even a mild increase. Bottom line is it gives you a weird flavor and some vitamins but don't look to have the energy of the Energizer Bunny from it.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Pretty Good I was surprised that I actually lliked Vitamin Squeeze. I am usually not much of a fan of fruit punch flavored drinks, plus I was unsure of any odd taste or aftertaste.

It reminded me of Hawaiin Punch, which I haven't actually bought in at least 15 years just because of the sugar content.<br /><br />This product is sweet and fruity enough without any sugar.<br /><br />The downside was that I did not actually notice any energy. I drink energy drinks and also use a few different brands of energy pills off and on - so maybe I am used to a higher level of ""energy"" ingredients?<br /><br />I liked Vitamin Squeeze for the flavor, and vitamin content, but would not recommend it for an energy drink based on my experience with it.

However, if you add a good amount in, it improves the taste slightly.  It's got zero calories, zero sugar, and zero carbs.  Great for those who are always on the go.

B006MONQMC,"Ok, Kind of ""chemical' Tasting The bottle is very large and you'll get a lot out of it.  Intensity of flavor is to 'taste' - I think that's why they measure by 'a squeeze' rather than anything more scientific (also, for convenience).  By the end of the bottle, I was able to quickly figure out how much of a squeeze I wanted to get it to taste the way I wanted.<br /><br />That said, the flavor does taste very 'chemical' like. I'm not sure if they want me to feel like I am getting vitamins or if they were going more for a 'sports drink' type of flavor.  My husband, who is a fitness nut, didn't mind the flavor at all.  Me, I found it very off-putting and far too fake.  I would have preferred more of a crystal light than a Powerade flavor.<br /><br />The bottle is very convenient - makes it easy to fill up a normal water bottle, add my squeeze, and then off I go on the bike or trip.

B006MONQMC,"Kids love it This is definitely a bigger hit with the kids in the house than the adults. It's a fast and easy way to make a quick drink that's got more flavor than water, but not as sweet as Kool-Aid. It's a fun way to add a boost to a bottled water, or a little something to a plain glass of water, without the need for packets of powdered mixes. As with most all concentrated drink mixes like this, you have to watch not to get any on fabric or it will stain, a bit of an issue with kids. My kids like it enough to ask for it as a drink (partially I think because they can make drinks with this themselves), but it's not so great that it will replace the other favorite drinks in the home by the adults. These are a fun idea for taking along on trips as well, since you can skip all the packaging bulk and just take one of these and some reusable drink containers that you fill up with water. Great for those camping, RVing, on long trips or just for keeping in the car to add a shot of flavor to a bland bottled water.",1,1

It's pretty nice.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"It tastes like watered down fruit punch... no thanks. Not my thing. I'm not one of those guys that likes fresh lemon in my ice water, to me it tastes like watered down lemonade but many people I know like the slight hint of lemon. This fruit punch is a bit stronger then the watered down lemon taste, but it's not that much stronger. It does turn your drink red, it does have a bit of a taste but frankly it's not enough of a taste for me to go for it. I would rather drink plain water then this flavoring.<br /><br />Other reasons why I don't like it, the bottle is pretty large, and once you open it you need to keep it refrigerated. This means I can't leave it in my desk at work and pop it in my water bottles as I open a new one. That eliminates the convenience factor. If I am going to refrigerate it I might as well make a full pitcher of a drink.<br /><br />The flavor, size of this and lack of portability due to the need to refrigerate this means I won't be using it anymore.

B006MONQMC,"Okay Flavoring, Didn't Feel any Energy Boost For me this wasn't the best flavoring, but it doesn't taste bad.  It didn't really taste like Fruit Punch to me, though.  I really like the Crystal Light fruit punch, or even the store brand versions of it, and this had a really ""off"" taste.  It says one squirt, and at first I used a pretty generous squirt to my bottled water, but I had to add to it two more times after that to get the flavor right.  I don't know if its because it's ""healthy"" or ""sugar-free"", because Crystal Light isn't too bad for you either, and again, tastes great to me; but the flavor on this was just way off for me.  Maybe if I tried Cherry as someone else recommended, that might be better.  I like Cherry so I might like that more.  There isn't a bad after-taste or anything like that, so I would definitly be willing to try that.  In the meantime, with this flavor, however, it doesn't appeal to me and I have a feeling my 6 and 13 year olds will be finishing it off.  Not that I'd want them having ""energy"" drinks, but I didn't get any kind of boost out of this and it does seem pretty healthy.  We don't buy koolaid or let them have pop except special occassions, pizza nights, stuff like that anyways, so this seems like a decent alternative to koolaid and they really like crystal light too.  I don't think they will mind the taste as much as I do, I am definitly a bit pickier and spoiled in my 32 years!  It was okay though and wouldn't mind trying another flavor but wouldn't really recommend the fruit punch.  There's better stuff out there tastewise for cheaper and again, there's not really an energy kick to this.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Just okay.... I generally like the taste of fruit punch, but this tastes watered down, even if I add an extra squeeze of it to my drinking glass.  The product concept is good, and I like the added caffeine and vitamins.  But the taste of the drink needs to be a little stronger.  Of course, I can add an extra squeeze of the product, but them I am also getting extra caffeine which is not always a good thing.<br /><br />I was surprised at the size of the bottle, because I was expecting a very small bottle like the similar Mio product uses.  This is definitely too large to carry around in my purse.  At any rate, it is recommended to refrigerate it after opening, so I will continue to carry Crystal Light packets in my purse.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"Not a Fan After drinking this, I was torn on what i thought about it but the kicker was the taste. I've never been a huge fan of fruit Punch and this reminds me of any drink that has that title. It tastes exactly the same as everything else. To make me want to squeeze something into my water and go that extra mile, I want to have something beautiful at the end of the rainbow. Fruit Punch - not exactly a pot of gold.<br /><br />As for claims of being good for you, the label does say its so but my testing kit was at the cleaners so I'm not really sure. I suppose it is like anything else; you can take the bottle at value and hope for the best but, in the end, like the way it tastes as well.<br /><br />One last thing on this is the amount you should pore. When it says to add a squeeze, i'm not exactly sure what that is. I added, sipped, added, sipped some more, trying to get my amount. Personally, I would have liked a spoon comparison or something.

I've given them all the excuses I could come up some true and others made up just to get them to drink it. Of course their excuse was ""water has no flavor"" or ""it doesn't taste good"", so when Mio first came on the market I thought that might be something to try, something to enhance the flavor and get them drinking. Unfortunately when I'm not around Mio tends to become the ""new juice mix"". Although I don't mind the enhancement of water to encourage kids to drink I'd still prefer them to drink regular plain water.<br /><br />When Vine offered this product for review, the first thing that caught my eye was ""Vitamin"". Well why not give this a try. I was impressed. Since this one required just one squeeze I emphasized that my 11yr old would be the one doing the squeeze and that's all they were going to get. Well after their first squeeze the kids declared that it actually tasted good. Not as great a Mio but good enough.<br /><br />My issues with this is that I would have much preferred to have them tell me 1tsp/1tbsp etc instead of a squeeze. Not everyone squeeze the same. The other issue is that it does require refrigeration and because of its size it's not portable unlike Mio which I can stick in my purse and take to the park.<br /><br />I haven't checked out the other flavors but will stick with Mio because of the ultra portability and the ability to get a vast assortment of flavors without having to buy a pack of 4 from Amazon of this product.",1,0

It was just okay.<br /><br />It was hard to measure ""a squeeze"". The bottle has markings, but since it's gray, you can't see how much you've used. Plus, every time you squeeze, it's a little different. The first cup I tried, I squeezed some in without measuring. It seemed a little weak. Then, I measured 8 oz. water and 1 tablespoon (the .5 oz serving listed on the bottle) of the Energy drink. This produced a stronger tasting and much sweeter tasting outcome. But, that was a little strong on the vitamin taste.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor isn't horrible, but the sugar substitute and the vitamins leave an after taste. It reminds me a little of chewable children's aspirin or cold tablets.

The taste is good if you like fruit punch, it doesn't have a very overwelming taste. I usually like a stronger tast and even adding a little more, it was not to sweet or overwhelmingly strong. I like the fact that as you make it a bit stronger, you don't have to worry about it getting really sweet.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes a bit like Kool-Aid This is a vitamin-containing flavor enhancer for water.  You squeeze this into your water (one squeeze for 8 oz of water).  This gives you some flavor, a bunch of vitamins, and some caffeine.  The flavor of this was reminiscent of Kool-Aid.  For a drink that is supposed to be full of health benefits, this contained an awful lot of artificial colors.  I found this a bit too sweet and a bit too artificial.",0,0
B006MONQMC,"It's good, not great The flavor of this drink is good when you mix it with water. It pretty much has that typical fruit punch flavor. The only thing is that I didn't know how much I should really add. At first I just squirted it once or twice into about 17 ounces of water, and the flavor was too light. Then I just kept squirting more and I ended up having to add more water because it was so sweet and had an strange aftertaste. Once you get the combo right it tastes pretty good, and if you mix it into cold water then the aftertaste is not nearly as obvious.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"No Calories lots of taste and Great on the go! Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink - Fruit Punch comes in a convenient 12 oz squeeze bottle so that you can take it wherever you go and give your water and extra kick of flavor and vitamins. I absolutely love this product. It's a great alternative for juice lovers, and flavored water lovers who don't want to sacrifice flavor for extra calories. Also children love it as well, my daughter drinks 5x more water now since I've got the Fruit Punch flavor.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink - Fruit Punch measure as one squeeze per every 8 oz of water, however no matter how much you squeeze into your glass (if you prefer the flavor to be slightly stronger) it will always be ZERO calories and full of vitamin C, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium, potassium,  vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B6 & vitamin B12.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to everyone who loves juice, flavored water, or just wants a Zero calorie drink with lots of flavor.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Helpful product for people bored by plain water Although fruit punch isn't my favorite flavor, I like the idea of adding some flavor, vitamins and little caffeine to make plain water or seltzer more interesting. It adds enough sweetness without being to sweet and you can adjust the intensity of the flavor by how many squeezes you add. Everyone else I let try this liked it as well. I will probably get it again, just a different flavor.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Good idea, but ingredients differ from what the Amazon web page says This appeared to me to be an ideal product--providing a little bit of fruit flavor and also vitamin C to water--a variant on my habit of adding a little juice to drinking water (which does encourage more drinking, a good thing particularly in the summertime).  Unfortunately, the ingredients on the bottle I received differ from what's listed on the Amazon web page, and include taurine, which is animal-derived.<br />If you are not a vegetarian you still may wish to try this, based on the other reviews.  You may wish to measure the product since, as others observe, a ""squeeze"" can be more or less generous.",-1,0

B006MONQMC,"An Odd Flavor -- Different Everytime, Too There's this neat looking scale on the side of the bottle that looks like it is your way of telling how much to put in each drink, but there are three problems:<br /><br />1) The bottle is irregularly shaped, so each unit is a different size depending on how wide the bottle is at that point,<br />2) When you squeeze the bottle, you distort it so the level rises instead of falls upon dispensing, and (most importantly)<br />3) The label is opaque, so you can't see the fluid level anyway!<br /><br />So I have no idea how much a ""squeeze"" is supposed to be. My squeeze is probably different from your squeeze. Heck, my morning squeeze is different from my afternoon squeeze. So each time I use this, I get a different, indeterminate amount. Who knows how much of the vitamins I'm getting!<br /><br />And what's worse is the flavor is a little different every time. Sometimes it tastes exactly like Pepto-Bismol, and other times it tastes like a flat fruit drink box.

B006MONQMC,"I like the taste, but it feels heavy on caffeine I think the flavor of this product is close to Kool-Aid, which depending on your point of view may be good or bad.  I actually liked the fruit punch flavor- definitely old school after all the new flavor combinations companies come up with these days.  I drank it both watery and strong, and when drinking it strong, it feels like it has a lot of caffeine.  Initially, I felt a little jittery, but it passed quickly.  I don't know if it's necessarily high in caffeine (since it's hard to judge how much actually goes into a glass of water), but I definitely felt it.  It may be the combination of the caffeine and Vitamin C.  To me, it falls somewhere between drinking a Red Bull (not too strong) to Monster (very strong).  Still, it's a decent product and I would buy it again.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Is it preferable to plain water?  I think not. I think the company that manufactures this item is counting on the fact that most people want a ""quick fix"" in an effort to be healthy.

Relatively high in Vitamin C and since our bodies need Vitamin C all day long, it is never a bad thing to keep it coming.<br /><br />The flavor was ok.  Not something I will crave, but not bad.

It tastes ""red"" at least.  And remotely medicinal, but that didn't bother me too much.<br /><br />Another reviewer suggested adding to milk.  I did so with positive results.

B006MONQMC,"Lots of color but taste was a little disappointing This Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is supposed to taste like fruit punch, but I didn't taste any fruit that I could recognize.  It's kind of a nondescript blend that has what I would describe as a ""generic"" flavor.  With so many good flavors available today I would have liked to see a product that had fruit flavors that I could actually pick out in the blend, like home made punch.  It didn't have an aftertaste, which is a positive. I like that there are 0 calories per serving.  A serving is 1/2 ounce according to their label and there are 24 servings to the container.  It's hard to say what a ""squeeze"" is or how much you're going to squeeze out each time.  It varies for me.  Sometimes the drink would be too weak, other times, just right. I added it to water in a sports drink bottle and it was convenient to drink it that way.  Adding ice improves the taste.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed as: Water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12.  I'm not sure if it's the caffeine or the added vitamins that give me the energy after drinking it, but I do feel a little bit energized after a couple glasses.

B006MONQMC,"I like it. For a zero calorie soft drink, I like Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink better than most other similar drinks. It tastes good, with no noticeable after-taste. I use a little less than the recommended amount to suit my taste. I haven't noticed any real energy boost though. I'll stick to coffee if I need a caffeine jolt. As for the vitamins its infused with, I guess they can't hurt, but don't confuse Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink as something healthy. It's a zero calorie, zero carb beverage, that is sweetened with Sucralose. They also added some caffeine and vitamins, but it's probably more for marketing than anything else. If you're a fan of diet soft drinks, you'll probably like Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. If you don't like sugar free soft drinks, then definitely look elsewhere.",1,1

B006MONQMC,"Is this a health drink or a kids drink? If people bought ""energy"" drinks solely on the basis of taste, the market for these products would shrink pretty quickly because most of these drinks have no definable taste profile and mostly taste like diluted Kook-aid. Fortunately for companies like the aptly named Vitamin Squeeze, buyers have been so conditioned by the giant beverage companies (e.g., Gatorade, Coke, Pepsi, etc.) to accept gawdawful concoctions falsely marketed as ""flavors"" that what the product actually tastes like is of little or no concern when the purchase decision is made.<br /><br />It's hard to tell what the makers of ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink"" want you to think of their product. The product description suggests this is an energy/vitamin drink that will enhance your health. The packaging and flavor descriptions (e.g., ""fruit punch"") suggest this stuff is a kids' drink along the lines of Kool-aid injected with a jolt of caffiene.<br /><br />I tried to ignore the marketing buzzwords completely and focus on the taste and the convenience factor. In terms of taste, if you ignore the flavor listed on the label, you'll have a tough time describing what this product actually tastes like. It's definitely not fruit, and it doesn't taste like any punch I'd consume. I'd say it tastes kind of sweet and mostly artificial. It's drinkable, as long as your expectations are very low and you're OK with a drink that is red and sweet and not much more.<br /><br />The packaging is pretty cool, though, and portioning is easy - which is why a product like this exists. Just fill an empty bottle with water, squeeze in a little concentrate, shake, and you've got a cheap energy drink in seconds.<br /><br />If Vitamin Squeeze can produce a drink that tastes like something grown, not manufactured, I'd have this stuff stacked to the ceiling in my pantry. Until then, I'll pass.",0,-1
B006MONQMC,"For active adults, better choice than Mio This was my first time to try ""Vitamin Squeeze"" brand water enhancer, although I am very familiar with the similar Mio brand that's been on the market for quite a while.  Even though I knew that this container would be 12-ounces, I was still amazed when I opened the box to discover how truly large this bottle was compared to Mio water enhancer.  The Vitamin Squeeze bottle is about three times larger than a Mio bottle, although it actually holds 12-ounces as opposed to Mio's 1.6-ounce.  But please note that they actually offer the exact same number of servings (24).  Mio is concentrated, while Vitamin Squeeze is not -- as was clearly stated on the package.  As far as taste, quality, and appearance was concerned, I don't think the lack of concentration made any difference.  It's also worth noting that Vitamin Squeeze should be kept in the fridge, unlike Mio which I store in my pantry.  This might be a serious issue for those interested in carrying a bottle around in a purse or gym bag, in addition to its unwieldy size.<br /><br />I received one bottle of the Fruit Punch flavor to try out, and I decided to compare it directly with the Mio version of Fruit Punch to provide a more accurate review.  Mio's punch is a bright, rich -- almost unnatural -- red, like Kool Aid, and it tastes like it too.  Vitamin Squeeze delivers a more subtle pink-orange colored beverage, and the taste is very different.  It is not overly sweet, like Mio.  In fact, my first impression was that it tasted more like the fruit punch flavor of Gatorade I drank years ago when I was in high school.  I tried the Vitamin Squeeze at different times of the day.  It was not a very pleasant drink first thing in the morning, though it was actually quite refreshing -- more so than the sticky sweetness of Mio -- after a morning workout.  I tried to drink it with a meal but quickly gave up.  I'd rather enjoy water or soda.  This ""fruit punch"" stands on its own and didn't see to go well with food of any kind.  Finally, I let my four-year-old daughter try it for the ultimate test.  She's a big fan of Mio, which she calls ""magic fruit punch,"" and often uses it at dinner to flavor her water.  She disliked Vitamin Squeeze and would only drink one sip, which she dismissed as unsweet and yucky.<br /><br />My conclusion is that, while Mio's Kool Aid-type punch is great for kids, Vitamin Squeeze is probably a better choice for active adults, especially since it does provide a few vitamins (nothing much beyond your typical 100% Vitamin C) and tastes great and not too sweet after a workout.  The 12-ounce bottle is a bit clunky, needs to be stored in the frige, and you really have to squeeze a couple of generous full-bottle squirts into your water bottle to get a real taste of the product.  I have my doubts that my bottle will make it all the way to a full 24 servings, and I stopped keeping track after about six or so.  Given the choice, I think I would choose Vitamin Squeeze over Mio.",1,1
B006MONQMC,"Tastes good and works also with milk...I'm sold on it For once, we reviewers get enough of a food product to really test it and write up a fair review.

B006MONQMC,"Yuck!!! Qustionable benefits and tough to dispense I did not like this product for three reasons:<br /><br />1) Taste - putting everything else aside, this stuff tastes terrible.  It is fruit punch flavored, and I generally don't mind fruit punch.  But, this is really very fruity and reminded me of those horrible sugar drinks we used to drink as a kid.  I really found the taste hard to get past.<br /><br />2) Dispenser - the product makes a big deal about the one squeeze per 8oz of water (a standard side water bottle).  It didn't work because there is no indication how big a squeeze to give.  I was expecting something like is found on Act mouthwash.  One squeeze could be a couple of drops or most of the bottle.  There is also no way to see how much is left in the bottle because of the opaque wrapper.<br /><br />3) Questionable benefits - The label says this stuff adds vitamins C, B3, B5, B6 and B12, caffeine, taurine and electrolytes.  It gives odd measures of each benefit - sometimes as a % (presumably of RDA) and sometimes as mg.  For electrolytes it says it has two lightningbolts worth.  Most of this stuff you can get easily elsewhere from a normal diet.  Taurine has been proven to be of no established benfit.  Caffeine? Well, I can't really comment on why you would want that in an energy drink.  Many of these ""benefits"" are also not clearly placed in an energy drink or a recovery drink.  I have absolutely no idea how many electrolytes are contained in two lightningbolts.  It is not a measure I am familiar with.<br /><br />Two stars, not one, because it did not make me sick or anything.",-1,-1
B006MONQMC,"It's got electrolytes Or so the bottle wrapping claims and there's more: Vitamins C, B3, B5, B6, B12 plus 'natural' caffeine and... Taurine.

Well, whatever it is, according to Wikipedia, ""a review published in 2008 found no documented reports of negative or positive health effects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks"" so it probably doesn't hurt to have some.<br /><br />The end product, after squeezing the concentrate into a glass of water is that the water color changes to orangy-red and it acquires a vaguely fruity synthetic smell and flavor and, according to the wrapping, it gets 120% of your daily Vitamin C needs.<br /><br />To answer the question: 'after my first glass, would I have another one?' I must admit that I wasn't able to actually finish my first glass. I wouldn't call it 'bad tasting' but I'd rather have my drinking water clean and maybe some fruit on the side or some mostly natural fruit juice to fulfill may daily requirements of Taurine, Vitamin C, Sodium Benzoate and the ever-essential electrolytes.",-1,0
